<h2>TO THE READER</h2>


<p>Admirers of William Morris&mdash;among whom
I count all his readers&mdash;will recognize the personal
description of John Ball as taken from his
"A Dream of John Ball." They will also note
that some parts of his sermon as well are from
the same book. It seemed to me that certain
bits of Morris's imaginative work were too fine
and true to be spared in any attempt to set the
blunt old poor priest before the modern reader.
I have no fear of bearing off undeserved palms;
for just as a few of the sayings of John Ball bear
the marks of authenticity too clearly upon them
to be mistaken for mine, so such as are taken
from Morris are as clearly distinguished by the
marks of supreme beauty and genius.</p>

<p>In the course of many years of close reading,
it is inevitable that there should have been woven
into this book some of the ideas and prepossessions
of certain Church historians. Although
many other writers have been exceedingly helpful
and suggestive, I want especially to acknowledge
my indebtedness to Renan, Kingsley, Fisher,
Baldwin Brown, Gosselin, Braun, Montalembert,
Vincent, and Sheppard.</p>

<h2>I</h2>


<p>The great Minster of the Fens never looked
lovelier than at the close of a November day, 1379.
The coloring of Fenland is not attuned to the
brightness of Spring or Summer, but there is in
the late Autumn a subtle quality that brings out
its true charm. The dull browns and yellows of
the marshes, the warm red-browns of the rushes,
the pale greens of the swamp grasses with the
glint of the sun low down at their feet,&mdash;all on
this day found just the right complement in the
great, heavy, gray clouds that broke here and
there only to show irregular bars of saffron sky.
Just before night fell there was one supreme
moment when a patch of gold lingered in the
north just over the wonderful octagon, the glorious
crown of St. Audrey, and the great west front
with its noble tower and its wealth of windows
flung the orange gleam of the setting sun over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>the landscape as a gauntlet proudly thrown in
the face of Night. The lordly outlines of the
vast edifice looked lordlier than ever as the slowly
gathering darkness descended and drew it up into
itself.</p>

<p>The east wind blowing from over the sea, pungent
with the odor of marsh plants, was keen,
and caused a man who was surveying the scene
to gather his thin gown more closely about him.
Until he stirred, this man might almost have been
taken for a part of the landscape, so admirably
did his garb of coarse russet sacking harmonize
with his surroundings. Although he shivered
slightly, he did not move from his position, but
remained with arms tightly folded on his breast,
and his deep-set eyes fixed earnestly upon the
solemn pile before him. A solitary figure he
stood in the vast stretch of sky and land, and he
felt himself peculiarly alone. Yet as he faced
the Cathedral there was no sign of faltering or
dread in his face, but rather a distinct note of
defiance.</p>

<p>Not long before, the stately procession of
priests had departed from the Vesper service.
A choir boy of angelic countenance, but impish
spirit, had for an instant trailed his violet robe
in the dust and flung the stone he picked up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>straight at the russet form. Not a priest in line
but envied the boy. Outwardly, the russet priest
showed no sign. He thought of St. Francis who
had been stoned by the very ones who later
placed those stones under his direction. Also
he thought of the stoning of One greater than
St. Francis.</p>

<p>One year before, at Oxford, Robert Annys
had bidden farewell to his beloved master, John
Wyclif, and had become one of his noble band
of poor priests,&mdash;or russet priests, as they were
familiarly dubbed,&mdash;who went about the country,
preaching the Gospel and teaching the people
how to read, that they might bring Holy Writ
more closely into their lives. As a student, he
had passed many happy years by the side of his
great master at Balliol, translating the Bible into
the language of the people so that they might
come to know God and love God by themselves
without the shadow of the priestly office ever
between. Nevertheless, although he had been
well content to pass all his life in that beautiful
manner, when the time came that his master
ordered him out into the world, he went without
a murmur and bravely, empty handed, with no
more thought of the morrow than had the twelve
whom Christ had bidden:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"Take nothing for your journey, neither staff, nor wallet, nor
bread, nor money; neither have two coats."</p></div>

<p>Since then he had lived close to the people, he
had been of the people. He had come to them,
not with the crumbs from the Communion table
but with the strong bread of life. He had
preached the Gospel in the fields while the heat
rose in palpitating waves, and on the downs while
the hail beat on his bare head; he had prayed
over them while the shears dripped white from the
sheep of their overlord; he had hungered with
them and thirsted with them and shared such
coarse food as they had; he had watched with
them as some worn soul departed from its worn
body. His way had led to no sumptuous oratories
of towered castles, to no cushioned <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">prie-dieux</i>
in scented chambers. He had shrived,
not grand seigneurs and haughty dames whose
momentary comfort had been disturbed by the
pricking of a superficial regret, but strong, simple
souls who trembled from the sway of tremendous
feeling&mdash;men who thirsted for the blood of their
child's betrayer, victims who raged at infamous
injustice and brooded over desperate means to
escape their thraldom. No lightly felt peccadilloes
were confessed to him, but the agony and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>shame of those whose tortured souls hung betwixt
heaven and hell.</p>

<p>And he had grown to love this life. He had
thought to have a peculiar aptitude for letters, and
his master had never altered translation wrought
by him. Yet he knew now that his gift lay rather
in swaying men, and one short year had done
much to make his name known from Sussex to
Lincolnshire. No wonder, then, that he had joy
in his work, for it is not given to man to know
greater happiness than this: to watch the face of
a fellow-man kindle with a new and great hope,
which he knows he has planted within the
other's breast. Yet deep down within there had
been slowly growing in his heart a secret questioning.
He had been warned by his master to
hold himself strictly to the work of spreading the
knowledge of the Gospel, and he had been clearly
enjoined against undoing the peace of the realm
and setting serfs against their masters, as a certain
mad priest named John Ball was even at that
moment doing, both by the reckless violence of
his language and the revolutionary quality of his
theories. It was easy for Wyclif in the shelter
of the University to warn against over-haste and
to protest that education must come before a lasting
reform could be accomplished, and that one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>must build on solid foundations for the future. It
was not so easy for the wandering poor priest,
with the sufferings of the people ever before him,
to refrain from pressing the Gospel into immediate
action. Annys began very soon to suspect
that it was impossible to feed the people with the
knowledge of Holy Writ and expect no indigestion
to come from the strange diet. If Life truly
began to be tested by Holy Writ, some idols must
fall&mdash;if the Church Hierarchical, alas for it! If
Christian society were to be modelled on the plain
teachings of its Founder, some strange sights
would be seen.</p>

<p>Annys had not needed to be stoned to feel rise
up within him a fierce hatred toward that stately
church that reared its head so haughtily to
heaven. Ah, truly he held with St. Boniface of
old that "in the catacombs the candlesticks were
of wood, but the priests were golden. <em>Now the
candlesticks are of gold.</em>"</p>

<p>That morning, when he preached to the men in
the fields and told them in homely language of
the life of their Lord and His death to save them,
a summons had come from the Bishop of Ely bidding
Robert Annys appear before him. And,
wondering what the Bishop could want of him
(unless to order him peremptorily from his diocese,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>in which case it was scarcely necessary to do
so in person), he had had himself rowed over the
wide-spreading meres that separated the isle of
Ely from the mainland. As he slowly approached
the glorious pile, there came over him with a curious
stir the memory of that King Canute who had
also been thus rowed across and who had bade
the oarsmen pause midway that he might listen to
the beautiful chanting of the monks.</p>

<p>Truth to tell, for all his passionate disdain for
what lay outside of the true heart of Christianity,
he was more profoundly moved by the beauty of
Ely Minster than he would have dreamed it possible.
For he was an ardent student of history,
and here before him was wrought as true and
noble an epic as ever was writ on parchment.
Into these noble arches and soaring towers, these
delicate pinnacles, these exquisite traceries, surely
the adoring heart of Mediævalism had lavishly
poured itself. This russet priest was an artist
and worshipped beauty, hence he could not look
on Ely unmoved. He was an Englishman to the
fingertips, hence he could not stand on ground so
alive with heroic traditions and not thrill to the
memory of them. As he stood there in the gathering
darkness before the church, he saw a long
struggle before him. He saw the Bishop of Ely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>and the whole powerful Church of Rome leagued
against him. And why? Because he followed
Christ's clear mandates. Yet he was certain that
nothing that the Hierarchy could do would conquer
him. He would stand to the end, alone if
need be, but fearlessly true to his convictions,
true to the master who had sent him out into the
world to do His work. Something of the grim determination
of those Saxons of old entered into
him, those hardy warriors who had fought so
many hundred years before on that very spot and
made their last dogged stand against the conquering
Normans; something, too, of the undaunted
will of that old monk-architect, who, even
amid the roar of the falling walls of the old tower
of Ely, had conceived the great new tower, the
wonderful octagon which was unique in all
England.</p>

<p>No! no threat of imprisonment or other punishment
on the morrow could make him swerve from
the course he had chosen. He would continue
to go among his people with only a book and a
bag. His people who awaited him among the
hayricks, who let plough rest idle in the furrow
or tossed aside the spade that they might hearken
to him. <em>His people!</em> His eyes dimmed with
tears as he thought of the pathetic figure of Piers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>Ploughman standing in the fields, the light of a
great wonder in his face,&mdash;Piers in the condition
of a man who has had his eyes bandaged for a
long time, and now for the first time has had
the bandage removed. In the strange light that
now bursts upon him the most familiar objects
take on a new and strange appearance. In the
transformation that is going on about him, all
that his honest heart has held stable, omnipotent,
eternal, now sways unsteadily before him: Feudal
Lords, Sheriffs, King's men and Kings; Fees in
Tithe, Manorial Holdings, Rights of Labor, Acts
of Parliament, and even Holy Church herself.
No, no, come what may, he could never desert
Piers now:&mdash;</p>

<p>The night closed slowly down upon the Cathedral.

<h2>II</h2>


<p>The following morning Thomas Goldynge,
Bishop of Ely, lay in bed awaiting those to whom
he had promised audience. It was with considerable
curiosity that he awaited the young poor
priest whom he had summoned. He sighed with
relief as he realized that the hard fight which he
had waged against Rome was ended. It was a
contest over the best method of suppressing the
poor priests, and it had taken many secret embassies
to Rome, and many letters in cipher sent to
trusted friends at the Papal Court. Indeed, it had
looked at one time as if the Bishop himself, aged
as he was, would have to undertake the long and
tedious journey to the Holy City, for the Bishop
looked upon this matter as one of vital importance
to the Church. He agreed with the Papal Legate
that the incendiary preaching of the poor priests
must be stamped out, but he had some theories
of his own as to this stamping-out process, and
persecution bore no part in them. He, more than
any other Churchman, realized that the English
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>people needed careful handling. How was the
Italian Legate to understand anything of the
rage and indignation that were growing up in
the hearts of the English against foreign subjection,
against a Church that gave the best sees in
the land to Italians who scarce deigned to make
acquaintance with the very outsides of their
churches? The substance of the people was being
wrung from them to help the cause of their bitter
enemies. The King of England had little or
nothing left for his needs because the Church
refused to give up one tittle of its moneys for the
good of the realm. Goldynge was an Englishman,
and he had struggled all his life to place Englishmen
in English churches. He was against the
new spirit of Nationalism, however, when it
asserted itself against the most sacred prerogatives
of the Church, for he could look far ahead
and see that this spirit might become powerful
enough to wreck the Church Universal and give
birth in England to a Church that would forswear
all allegiance to Rome. He was for doing all in
his power to redress the wrongs of the people and
keep the breach from widening, for Holy Church
had about all the schisms it could well take care
of for some time to come.</p>

<p>When Robert Annys was ushered in with head
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>flung well back and every line in the lithe young
body eloquent of a proud defiance, the Bishop
raised himself on the pillow and looked long and
eagerly into his face. Therein he read all that he
had counted to find. In the deep-set eyes, the
high, narrow brow, the sensitive mouth, the delicately
chiselled chin, there were revealed to the
shrewd old prelate the enthusiastic temperament
of a reformer, the idealism of a poet, the puissant
desire to work, to change, to remake. And
also, and therein lay his secret satisfaction, he
read the fine acumen of a critic. A dangerous
quality that, which was certain to make war upon
the other qualities that struggled in his breast.
Here was before him no blunt fanatic like John
Ball, flying as unswervingly to his goal as the
arrow shot from the bow, but one with the discerning
mind that weighs, discriminates, and looks
far enough ahead to see its own heart-break at the
end.</p>

<p>"You sent for me?" although the tone was
defiant, it was less so than Annys had intended it.
Somehow he found it hard to be arrogant to this
gentle old man whose flowing locks looked whiter
than ever against the deep red of the bed-curtains.
Only a beautiful old man upon his couch, looking
at him with dim kindly eyes and a mouth that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>smiled. Far rather would he have faced a haughty
prelate in rustling robes&mdash;that would have roused
him and strengthened him in his hatred of all for
which a Bishop stood.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the old man, very gently, "I have
sent for thee, for I have heard much of this russet
priest who sways great bodies of men as they
hearken to him, even as row upon row of corn is
swayed by the wind that blows across the fields.
I wished to see him and hold converse with him."</p>

<p>"Why should I come here before you that you
may look upon me? I owe no allegiance to the
Bishop of Ely. I serve him not, I serve only my
master, John Wyclif."</p>

<p>"And our Master, Jesus Christ?" mildly interposed
the Bishop.</p>

<p>"Yea, I serve <em>my</em> Master, Jesus Christ," asserted
the poor priest, "but"&mdash;he was annoyed
to find that the words in his heart did not rise
so easily to his tongue as he would have them
do. He felt the old man's eyes gravely fixed upon
him.</p>

<p>"But?" he suggested with sedate politeness&mdash;"but?"</p>

<p>The young man reddened with discomfiture,
but remained silent.</p>

<p>"I beg of you to go on," said the Bishop,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>suavely; "we are quite alone. I have sent for
you to understand what is in your heart, and I
would that you open it to me without fear."</p>

<p>The word stung the poor priest as the older
man knew it would.</p>

<p>"Fear? I have no fear. What should I fear?
I would say that one cannot serve two masters
at one time, the one Christ, the other Antichrist.
I do not see that one can bear at one and the
same time the pectoral cross and the cross of
Christ Jesus."</p>

<p>It was now the Bishop's turn to redden, but he
only bit his lip for an instant and then smiled
frankly. "I understand," he said, "I have heard
somewhat of this kind of thing before. You poor
priests claim that Christ founded no cathedrals, and
that He worked with fishermen instead of Bishops.
I know ye would like to see the palaces of Bishops
razed to the ground that bread might be placed
between the lips of the hungry, the gold of the
altars melted that it might run into the purse of
the poor. As your poet hath it,</p>

<div class="blockquot">
"'Let Bishops' horses become beggars' chambers.<br />
</div>

<p>Is that not it?"</p>

<p>His listener folded his arms tightly over his
breast and nodded for answer.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>
<p>"Ah, yes; ah, yes," continued the Bishop, musingly,
"do I not know? Was I not even as thou
in my youthful days? But I am an old man
now, and many things lie bathed in the clear
white light of knowledge that then lay darkly
shrouded in mystery. My dear son, you are only
one of many who fix their eyes on what should
have been, instead of on what really was. Ye
bury your faces within the pages of the Bible,
and if ye look up once to see what is going on
about you, it is only to contrast with impatience
the teaching and example of the Church Visible
with the teaching and example of Christ and His
disciples. Ye are willing to look on the Church
as it now is, and God knows there are faults and
crimes enough to excuse some of your impatience,
but ye refuse to look at the history of the
Church, and at the magnificent service it has rendered
in the cause of humanity. Ye refuse to
consider gravely and seriously the work that it has
accomplished, and to ask yourselves if any other
human agency could have done a tenth as well.
You critics are as men who have been saved by
a bridge from a wild and devastating stream, and
now once safely crossed, ye kneel down&mdash;not to
thank God Almighty for having saved you, but
to detect the flaws in the bridge."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>
<p>Annys could not but be moved by the eloquence
of the old man. He began to understand
something of the great power which had been
wielded from the throne of Ely. Yet he waited
not with his answer, "Christianity is no longer
the Church of Christ, it is the Church of Rome.
Why keep up the pretence longer? I am but
seeking to bring the people back to Christ as St.
Francis did before me."</p>

<p>"Ay! as St. Francis did before you. He was
so sure that all the world needed was the Word
and his Rule of Poverty. Well, how many years
after his death was it that the people complained
to the authorities of the great wealth of the
Franciscan monasteries?"</p>

<p>Annys remained silent.</p>

<p>"The Church is a more intricate matter than
any one Book or any one Rule," went on the
Bishop. "Why think you it was that the wolves
of the north, as St. Jerome well called them, those
wild tribes of Franks and Burgundians, of Vandals
and Goths and Visigoths, savage as their onslaught
was, yet paused in the face of Rome? Was it not
because the Churchmen at the critical time were
no idle dreamers, but the greatest statesmen the
world ever saw? Ah, my son, if temporal power
meant a fall from the early apostolic Church,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>do not forget that it was a fall brought about by
the very greatness of its own servants. It was
to the early Bishops that the world was forced to
look for its rulers when the reins of government
were slipping from the weak hands of all others.
It was Cyprian at Carthage, Jerome and Leo at
Rome, Ambrose at Milan, Augustine in Africa,
Boniface at the court of Pepin, Martin at Tours,
Hilary at Poitiers, and Marcel at Paris who were
doing the work of the world. It is easy to speak
of the Pope's need for Charles the Great when
he placed the diadem of the Cæsars on the Frankish
Emperor's brow; yet if Leo needed Charles,
Charles needed Leo, as well, and we do not quite
so often hear that. My son, the mitre has resisted
many a blow that would have shattered the sword."</p>

<p>"Ah, but how much finer had the Church of
Christ been built up even as Solomon would have
had it, if it could have truly been said of the Head
of the Church:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"'He shall not put his trust in horse or rider, and bow, nor
shall he multiply unto himself gold and silver for war, for he
shall smite the earth with the word of his mouth.'"</p></div>

<p>"A beautiful dream, no more, my son. Take
the Crusades; how easy is it for critics to aver
that an intriguing Pope started them to increase
his own glory and gratify his sense of power.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>Yet hast ever thought whether the peoples of
Europe would not have fallen upon and destroyed
one another but for the wise craft of a leader
who united them by finding a common enemy?
Now do not misunderstand me; no one more
than I realizes the awful sins of the Schismatic
Popes, the terrible greed of some of the powerful
Churchmen, their criminal neglect of their
charges; no one realizes more that the people
have wrongs that should be righted. But I am
sure it is for the good of the people that these
wrongs be righted from within the Church. The
people have no better friend than the Church. It
has been the one Institution which has sought
out the individual, and asked of him only what
service he could render it. In its bosom it has
held the divine spark of the equality of man, and
kept it there and protected it while the world was
not yet ready for it. It has nourished it until it
will be a flame great enough to light the torch of
Freedom.</p>

<p>"We agree, save that you think the world is
ripe for that spark, and I know that it is not;
loosed now, it will but scorch and sear; it is not
ready to illumine."</p>

<p>Annys had listened with profound earnestness
to the impetuous words of the great prelate; before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>he could respond, the speaker continued,
with a great light of enthusiasm in his face:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Think on the refrain which you know well.
Con it when you are tempted to think that the
Church has done naught for the people:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">"'Had they (the priests) been out of religion,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">They must have hanged at the plowe.</div>
    <div class="verse">Threshing and diking fro towne to towne,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">With sorrie meat, and not halfe ynowe.'</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>"What can that mean, save that the Church
hath taken up into its bosom the men who otherwise
had no career save the plough? True, the
time has come when the Church once again needs
to be drawn nearer to the people&mdash;the people
who all yearn for it and need it. Do not lead the
people away from it, lest in the end you destroy
their faith and undo them. The Church needs
just such workers as thou; come to us and work
with us. Stand no longer without!"</p>

<p>At this appeal, the young poor priest suddenly
roused himself.</p>

<p>"What? stand no longer without! work with
you! with a Church whose head hath launched
bull after bull against my master and his teachings?
Come within a Church that sets the ruling
of a man above the words of Holy Writ? The
chief article of my creed is that the Gospel suffices
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>for the salvation of Christians without the keeping
of ceremonials and statutes that have been made
by sinful and unknowing men. What work has
Holy Church for me? Surely there are others
who can mouth more glibly than I the words of
the Mass, and who are more deeply versed in the
labyrinths of canonical lore."</p>

<p>"What canst thou?" replied the Bishop, warmly,
"everything! Once within the Church, thou canst
raise the authority of the Scriptures, beat down
the vicious barriers that exist between the people
and the prelates. Remember, one blow from
within counts for ten from without. Come within,
and help me in my fight against foreigners who
care naught for the people who are their charge,
foreigners who never deign to approach these
shores, save perchance to count the moneys that
are yielded from their sees." Then with a swift
change his voice softened, and there was a pathetic
appeal in it. "I have fought hard for more than
thirty years," he pleaded. "I am worn in body
and spirit; if I die to-morrow without providing
for a successor, doubtless all that I have accomplished
will be as naught. The old conditions
in this diocese will arise again. There are many
priests and abbots&mdash;ay! and some higher than
they&mdash;who will click their heels gleefully over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>my grave. Come to Ely and be its Archdeacon.
I&mdash;nay!&mdash;the Church of Christ has need of
thee. Come!"</p>

<p>The poor priest was astounded. How could
this be that the archdeaconate of Ely should be
offered to a poor priest, one of Wyclif's band, so
distrusted and hated by Rome?</p>

<p>"You, the Bishop of Ely, you offer me this?
It is no jest?"</p>

<p>The Bishop smiled. "Well, I do not mind
confessing that it was no easy matter to bring
about. Yet why should we go on permitting you
to take people away from the Church? I am
persuaded that the people need the Church as
much as the Church needs the people. They
have your confidence; I want you to bring them
back to the altar."</p>

<p>"But, Father, the instant I doff this russet
gown and don the albe and stole, that instant the
people's confidence in me is gone."</p>

<p>"I cannot believe it has gone so far as that."</p>

<p>"Yea, I say it. It is too late to try to drag the
people back. They have grown weary of having
fat and lazy priests prate to them, with white hand
on full belly, of patience and humility and duty
to their overlords. Why do the people believe in
me? Why do they follow me? Because they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>wot well that my meals are as uncertain as their
own, that my face is roughened by the same wind
that roughens theirs. Because I can look into
their faces and say, 'I too have a-hungered, I too
have a-thirsted, I too have sweated in the fields.'"</p>

<p>The Bishop looked very old and tired. A sob
rose suddenly in the poor priest's throat. To his
own surprise, suddenly he flung himself upon his
knees before the couch.</p>

<p>"Little thought I, Father, when I came here
with defiance and distrust in my heart, that I
would fling myself on my knees before you; yet
it is true that I feel it as a great personal sorrow
that I cannot both stay with you and also answer
the call of my master. But I cannot desert my
people. Where they turn up the soil, where they
guide the plough, where their tired backs bend,
where the wind and the hail beat down upon
them in the fields, there is my place, and there I
must go."</p>

<p>The Bishop's sensitive face quivered with emotion.
He remained silent an instant and then
looked up into the young man's face. "Wilt
promise me one thing?"</p>

<p>"If I can, Father."</p>

<p>"Wilt preach the sermon in the Cathedral next
Sunday?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>
<p>Annys hesitated an instant before he replied.
"Only to give the sermon," he stipulated.</p>

<p>"I shall celebrate the Mass myself. I would
like you to give the sermon just as you are.
There will be a goodly number of people, and it
is my whim that you should be heard once from
the pulpit. It will come with a new authority.
Besides," he added, with a twinkle in his eye, "I
should like to have some of our priests hear it.
It might not be a bad thing for the Nuncio himself."</p>

<p>And thus, before he departed, Robert Annys
had given his promise to deliver the sermon on
the following Sunday at Ely.</p>

<p>The Bishop did not yet acknowledge himself
defeated. Well he knew the magnetism of the
wonderful old church. Well he knew that men
did not preach before three thousand souls in Ely
Minster and then lightly step forth on their way
again.</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>



<h2>III</h2>


<p>The following Sunday a great concourse of
people flocked to the Cathedral. There was
much curiosity concerning the sermon of the
poor priest. Many who for years had been accustomed
on the plea of ill-health or old age to ask
for a stave for support during the long service,
now passed by the doorkeeper oblivious of everything
save their desire to secure a good place in
which to stand.</p>

<p>To begin with, sermons were growing infrequent.
In some churches they had fallen into
complete disuse, and it had been necessary for the
"Father Bishops" to enjoin "upon all those that
had under them the cure of souls openly in English
upon Sundays to preach and teach them that they
know God Almighty."</p>

<p>And even when there was a sermon, it frequently
turned out to be upon some light and
immoral bit from Ovid or Boccaccio taken as a
text, while the people hungered for the words of
the Gospel. Or perhaps some formal schoolman
would preach upon the seven works of mercy, or
the seven spiritual sins: "Pride&mdash;that lyking of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>office and high state, Envy&mdash;that sorrowe at the
syte of welefare and ioy, Anger&mdash;that wykkyde
stirrynge of herte, Gluttony&mdash;that lufe in taste
of mete and drynke, Covetousness, Sloth, and
Lechery,"&mdash;to which last were always tacked on
for good measure,&mdash;"Fornication, Adultery, and
Incest."</p>

<p>Holy Father! of what use was it to hear a
description of these sins. They were familiar
enough to all. What they wanted was some hope
and comfort in their daily life, some counsel in
their daily struggles, some love to help them bear
their daily burdens. And it was pretty certain
that the poor priest would give them that. When
at last a priest approached the altar and lit the
tall wax candles, full three thousand persons were
glad that their patient wait was at an end.</p>

<p>The ringing of the great bells of the Cathedral
and the breaking forth of the organ into sound
announced the arrival of the Bishop. The stately
procession appeared, blazing a sinuous path of
light and color through the dim spaces of the
chancel. First came an acolyte bearing the censer,
followed by the cross-bearer carrying the
great cross and escorted on either side by boys
with tall lighted tapers in their hands. After
them followed the entire body of clergy, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>Bishop, resplendent in his robes, leaning slightly
upon the two assistant deacons who accompanied
him. In his left hand he held the beautiful pastoral
staff, while the right hand was somewhat
elevated, as was meet, to bless such of the faithful
as might come upon his way. In the midst of all
the splendor of violet and gold and swaying lights
walked one slender figure in plain russet sacking,
a living protest against all the pomp and magnificence
that surrounded him.</p>

<p>Impressive figure! No buskins of cloth of
gold on those feet, no annice of pure white
linen about his head, no long linen albe reaching
to his heels, no girdle of white tasselled
silk. From those slender shoulders hung no
dalmatic gorgeous with embroidered border, nor
graceful chasuble of fine velvet studded with rare
pearls. Only a simple, bareheaded, poor priest
in a garb which had become a familiar sight
enough in the fields of harrowed earth or among
the rows of waving corn, but here in the Cathedral
a strange prophetic figure, portending the beginning
of the end&mdash;the end of a priesthood that
would act <em>before</em> the people, the beginning of a
priesthood that would act <em>for</em> the people; the
end of the sway of the mortmain with its icy
touch of the past, the beginning of the sway of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>the living hand, red with the quickly flowing
blood, warm with the throbbing sense of the
fellowship of man.</p>

<p>Through the hearts of the vast congregation
the solemn service swept, majestic, sublime, stupendous
in its power. Power? Everything spoke
of power. Power, power, power&mdash;the power of
the lesser clergy, the power of deacons and archdeacons,
the power of Bishops and Archbishops,
the power of the Papal Legate, the power of the
Pope, the power of Mighty&mdash;Imperial Rome.
What though the note of the prayers was always
humility? What knew the people of the Latin
words that rose to Heaven? What though the
exquisitely intoned phrases of the Bishop were all
a self-confessed unworthiness to appear before the
Lord? There was none of it observable in the
stately motions of the celebrant. What though
he cast himself upon his knees and cried out, "I
am an unclean sinner! Oh, wash me, dear Lord,
from all the stains of sin"? What the people
saw was a proud prelate in superb dalmatic,
wearing a golden mitre and carrying a jewelled
crozier. To them he was the great Bishop of
Ely, Peer of the realm, Lord of many towns,
holder of many manors, possessor of ten great
palaces of residence.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>
<p>Little by little the people's part in the service
had shrunk, until now the Mass was frankly but
a great and magnificent spectacle performed before
them, the choir and the clergy taking upon
themselves the responses that once had been the
duty of the congregation. It was well for the
people to know when to kneel, when to bow the
head, and when to genuflect. Also it was well to
remember that the devil writes down every word
said during Mass. Every one knew by heart the
tale which St. Augustine related to St. Gregory
the Great, of the two chattering women and the
fiend. And it was well to know that a special
indulgence is granted to all that kiss the ground
when the Mass is ended.</p>

<p>As the beautiful service took its course, the
young poor priest, who had come with a sneer on
his lips, found himself more profoundly stirred
than he would have liked to confess&mdash;even to
himself. While in the sacristy, he had been disgusted
at the levity of the priests who stood about
in evident indifference while the Bishop was being
most augustly invested. Small wonder that
they wearied of the infinitude of detail performed
before their eyes week after week without variation
of a motion or a word. It was the supreme
genius of Rome to enforce obedience to its slightest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>demand. It was beyond even that genius to
infuse life into the performance. Annys looked
about him during the investiture with a sickening
sense of the futility of it all. From the putting
on of the sandals to the last act of handing the
Bishop his beautifully embroidered gloves (the
deacon handing him the right one, the subdeacon
the left one) there must be no one prayer or
form omitted. The prelate must be surrounded
by eight acolytes upon their knees, the acolytes and
deacons who touch the episcopal vestments must
first wash their hands, the acolytes must elevate the
vestments, then they are solemnly passed over to
the deacons who do the actual enrobing. As the
Bishop receives each one of the nine different
articles, he must kiss each one and then murmur
the appropriate prayer for each.</p>

<p>What had all this to do with the telling of
"Christ and him crucified?" Alack for the holy
Church of Christ!</p>

<p>Yet, once within the noble interior of the Cathedral,
it was impossible not to fall completely
under the sway of the wonderful Art that had
squandered itself, not alone on the general conception,
but on each slightest detail of arch or
pillar, so that the least touch of the humblest
stonecutter revealed the presence of Genius.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>The mind was caught up and lifted to God by the
exquisite delicacy and grace of execution. If it
was but the carving of a single oak leaf, it was
done so that the breath of the woods stirred in
the perfect turning of the serrated edge.</p>

<p>And the ponderous, throbbing voice of the
organ, how it overwhelmed him! And the angelic
sweetness of the trained boy voices, how it
thrilled through him! The tears rose to his
eyes. He was in the presence of a Beauty, of a
Harmony, the very faintest shadow of which he
could not possibly have conceived. His will lay
dormant, a kind of stupor of deadly sweetness
crept over him. Not one sense that was not subjugated,
not one emotion that was not played upon.
There crept into his heart a whisper that perhaps
after all there was something in religion that was
not summed up in just a man and a book. Emotions
hitherto unknown thrilled through him as
he sat there with the wonderful service going on
about them. Once he came unexpectedly in contact
with the coarse sacking of his gown, and raged
against the harsh touch; he wanted to feel silk and
linen between his fingers.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Benedicamus Patri et Filio: cum Spiritu Sancto</span>,"</p></div>

<p>the sweetish fumes of the incense penetrated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>through the vast edifice. He forgot his dislike
of the pagan custom.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Gloria in excelsis Deo. Et in terra pax hominibus bonæ voluntatis</span>"</p></div>

<p>rang out from the choir, while the strong chords
of the organ filled the great spaces and made them
vibrate. His soul swooned in exaltation.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Laudamus te, Benedicimus te, Adoramus te, Glorificamus te</span>."</p></div>

<p>Yes, yes, he adored. He must have been mad
to refuse to spend his life ever within this glorious
Minster, ever within sight of these beautiful vistas,
ever within hearing of these heavenly sounds.
He would go immediately after the service to the
Bishop and confess his error. Fool, fool that he
had been to hesitate. Was it now too late?
Would the Mass never be over that he could fling
himself once again before the Bishop?</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"O Lamb of God that takest away the sins of the world, have
mercy upon us. O Lamb of God that takest away the sins of
the world, grant us peace."</p></div>

<p>Yes, peace, peace at any price. That was all
that his soul now yearned for. Could anything
be more divine than that exquisite refrain?</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Agnus Dei</span>."</p></div>

<p>Could the most hardened sinner listen unmoved
to that celestial music? He recalled the words
of the Bishop&mdash;the savage wolves of the north
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>pausing in the face of this&mdash;the great, visible,
tangible power of the Spirit. Oh, he could not
wait to confess to the Bishop how foolish and stiff-necked
he had been. He, Robert Annys, could
be the Archdeacon of Ely and he had refused it.</p>

<p>And yet, accompanying the strong emotional
exaltation, there came slowly over him a sense of
helplessness, as if a net were closing tightly down
over him, until there was no escape from its
entangling meshes. He felt the awful eye of
Rome upon him, the eye before which Barbarian
chiefs, and Emperors as well, had quailed. It was
not alone that the Papal Legate sat there before
him, the presence of Rome was felt in every one
of the countless forms of the Rubric. In the ringing
of the sacring bell, here twice, there thrice;
the position of the deacon and the subdeacon
as the celebrant chants the Introit; the kissing
and the incensing of the various articles that
are used in the service, the facing of the altar here,
and the facing of the congregation there; the putting
on of the mitre and the taking it off; the angle
of the body in the various degrees of bowing; the
precise position of the second and third fingers;
the placing of the veil over the host, slightly lower
on the right than on the left side; and finally the
giving of the left cheek for the kiss of peace.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>
<p>So much, so very much to come from the simple
rule: "Love your neighbors as yourselves."</p>

<p>He could not but think of that proud boast of
the Roman general, Scipio Africanus, "It is ever
our fate that conquered, we conquer."</p>

<p>Did Rome ever more truly conquer than when
apparently she lay crushed and helpless before the
triumphant Church of Christ? Had not the Holy
Roman Church (mark the very name!) of the
fourteenth century far more in it of pagan Rome
than of Hebraic Nazareth? Was there no one
to tell those people gathered there that all these
stately processions bringing with them light and
color into the twilight of the churches, these
swaying banners of gorgeous design, these choir
boys in violet robes, these tall, solemn-faced
priests resplendent in their vestments&mdash;all had
been employed centuries before to delight and
subjugate the Roman populace? Did they not
know that these same triumphal trains had
wound their way through gayly decorated streets
to the temples of the immortal gods? The
incense that was swayed so solemnly in the jewelled
censers, did they suspect that this same
sweet odor once rose at the feet of Roman idols?
Did they dream&mdash;these simple, confiding people&mdash;that
even the holy water itself was compounded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>from a heathen recipe? that even the very halos
about their saints were copied from the statue of
the wicked Nero, where it had symbolized the
glory of the sun? that the devotion paid to the
Pope had been received by Caligula, even down
to the kissing of his toe?</p>

<p>The entire organization of the Holy Roman
Church, what was it but the organization of Imperial
Rome changed merely in nomenclature?</p>

<p>He looked at the resplendent figure of the
Bishop: each scrap of the episcopal vestments
bore its special significance&mdash;the sandals signifying
purity, their red bows the patience of martyrs,
the girdle symbolizing continency, the two points
or horns of the mitre standing for the knowledge
of the two Testaments&mdash;and so on through every
detail&mdash;the annice which was wound about the
neck being a very encyclopædia of symbolism,
standing for five distinctly different things.</p>

<p>His eye rested a long time upon that wonderful
insignia of office, the pastoral staff, symbolically
shaped on the lines of a shepherd's crook.
The staff was of enamelled gilt copper terminating
in an ivory crook upon which was an exquisitely
carved figure of the Virgin. About the knop
were four compartments each containing a figure
illustrative of the history of David, while above
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>these were representations of the six vices overcome
by the same number of virtues, a pleasant
microcosm (which could scarcely be said to be
symbolic of the larger life on earth) where Faith
overcame Idolatry, Chastity conquered Impurity,
Charity swept away Envy, Temperance subdued
Gluttony, Bounty dispelled Avarice, and Peace
did away with Strife.</p>

<p>And was he to concern himself with all this&mdash;give
up his freedom to become a kind of prompter
to the Bishop? For the Archdeacon must see to
it that no slightest duty of the celebrant is overlooked,
that this part of the Gospel is read on the
north side of the altar and that part on the east
side, and see that his arms are extended here and
withdrawn there.</p>

<p>No, no, after all, his religion was of a totally
different kind.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"<cite>For where two or three are gathered together in my name
there am I in the midst of them.</cite>"</p></div>

<p>Surely nothing could be simpler. Surely the
religious life foreshadowed by these words of
Christ could take no thought of the countless
forms thrown together and ossified by the Hierarchy.</p>

<p>When the moment came for the delivery of
the sermon he arose with a new courage, his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>languor entirely thrown off. For as he faced
the vast congregation these words were ringing
in his heart:&mdash;</p>

<h2>IV</h2>


<p>For his text, Annys chose the words of Paul:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"And I, brethren, when I came unto you, came not with excellency
of speech or wisdom.... For I determined not to
know anything among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified....
And my speech and my preaching were not in persuasive
words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the spirit of power."</p></div>

<p>From this, he proceeded to lash the preacher
of the day, who, if he deigned at all to quote the
words of the Gospel, was so taken up with the
manner of his discourse that the matter seemed
of small import. And if such an one read the
Gospel of Christ, he must load each sentence with
evidences of his own learning, distort each saying
to show off his own cleverness, so that he doth
liken himself more to a mountebank who contorts
himself before a crowd to earn its applause and
catch its pennies, than to a sober minister of God.
He held to it stubbornly that to tell of Christ and
Him crucified, to spread the knowledge of "Goddes
Lawe," was the chief mission of Holy Church, and
that to live by the Gospel was complete salvation,
without the observance of certain forms set up by
man.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>
<p>"For sure it is," he said, "that they do punish
more the men who trespass against the Pope's
bulls, than those who trespass against Christ's
Gospel."</p>

<p>Bold words, these! Words that caused the
priests to writhe in their seats and cast meaning
glances at one another. The clearest Lollardry,
this! Forsooth! this one ragged priest to set
himself up against Ecumenical Councils, Synods
of the Holy Church, Decretals, Canons, Rubrics,
Curias, Popes; against the whole Hierarchy with
its hundreds of priests, its thousands of Masses,
its hundreds of thousands of worshippers; with
the strength of empires behind it, and the prestige
of the Imperial City,&mdash;this one ragged priest!</p>

<p>Cardinal Barsini, the Papal Legate, could scarce
restrain his rage. How dared Thomas of Ely to
offer high office to this stirrer-up of sedition and
heresy? Thomas of Ely, forsooth! this canny
Bishop will bear close watching. To be sure, he
had proved himself a very watch-dog of the funds
of the Church, and thus very useful to his Holiness
the Pope while the greedy Barons had been
making their onslaughts on the Church's Treasury.
Yet this same prelate had been most outspoken
in his belief that these same moneys should
be spent for the good of the English Church, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>not for the carrying on of foreign wars. "English
money must not help England's enemies,"
was the cry of the Bishop and his followers.
Basta! dangerous theories, these, to be crushed
down with a strong hand. And what nonsense
was this insolent poor priest prating of?&mdash;the
simplification of the priestly office was just what
the priesthood did not want. If it were necessary
merely to read the Gospel without explaining and
interpreting it, why, be a clerk and have done with
it. The aloofness, the dignity, the power of the
clergy would fall away instanter, the very fabric
of the Church Visible would crumble away before
their eyes.</p>

<p>While they fumed and bit their lips, the deep,
melodious voice of the young poor priest rang
through the church:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"'And about this time there arose no small stir concerning
the way. For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith,
which made silver shrines of Diana, brought no little business
unto the craftsmen; whom he gathered together with the workmen
of like occupation, and said, Sirs, ye know that by this business
we have our wealth. And ye see and hear that Paul hath
persuaded and turned away much people, saying that there be
no gods, which are made with our hands: and there is danger
that this our trade come into disrepute.'</p></div>

<p>"Now the priest that says unto himself, 'Behold,
if the mere words of Christ contain all of religion,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>what need is there for me?' is like unto that
Demetrius of old who feared to lose his trade of
making the silver gods. Shall we, then, continue
to place Imagery and Incense above the words of
Christ in order that the priestly trade fall not into
disrepute? Verily, to understand and teach the
word of Christ requires not such great learning; it
has been once understood by simple fishermen.
Now we are all more eager to appear versed in
the writings of the Fathers, than in the words of
Christ Jesus. The opinion of commentators hath
grown to exceed in importance the opinion of
Him who is commented upon. To know Anathasius
and Jerome and Augustine is placed
above knowing just Christ, and Him crucified. O
my friends, help me bring back the Church to
Christ Jesus&mdash;help me bring her back to the
fountain head of inspiration that she may be baptized
anew in the reviving waters."</p>

<p>There was an instant's silence, and then through
the vast interior there sighed the exquisite
benediction:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God,
and the communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all."</p></div>

<p>And slowly the people dispersed and went their
several ways.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>
<p>Long after the great church was empty, the
young poor priest remained before the altar, bowed
in prayer. He prayed fervently for light. He
tried to fasten his mind upon the one essential
question: Could he be of greater service to the
people as a poor priest going from town to town,
with the illimitable heavens, the waving trees, the
only cathedral; or as Archdeacon of the great
church of Ely, preaching a weekly sermon, helping
the Bishop reform abuses, investigating monasteries,
probing into the administrations of
abbots, visiting infrequently the scattered villages
within his diocese, striving to hold the people
within the Church? Perhaps he could prove
to them that not with all Churchmen&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The poor to pill is all their pray;"</p></div>

<p>that there were exceptions to those described in
the popular satire:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">"The pope maketh bishops for earthly thanke,</div>
      <div class="verse indent2">And nothing at all for Christ's sake,</div>
      <div class="verse">Such that been full fat and ranke,</div>
      <div class="verse indent2">To soul-heale none heed they take."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Perhaps, after all, as the Bishop had suggested,
his mission lay in stemming the tide of scorn and
distrust that was turning the people away from
Holy Church. After all, it was a stirring thought.
The sermon delivered, his whole being quivered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>with a new-born sense of power. The delight of
swaying great multitudes was upon him. The
pomp and pride of the place had entered into his
veins. A mighty ambition swept through him
which was by no means a mere carnal desire after
great wealth or position. It was not that he
craved the Bishopric of Ely with its ten palaces
of residence scattered through Hertfordshire,
Huntingtonshire, and Cambridgeshire, as well as
on the isle of Ely. It was not that he longed to
ride forth in state with banners flying and men
arrayed in his livery, and the arms of the See
blazoned on many a shield. Well was he familiar
with the sight of the arms of the noble house to
which Thomas of Ely belonged: Quarterly, first
and fourth gules a Lion rampant Or; second and
third Checquy Or and Azure; all within a Bordure
engrailed Argent. These he displayed beside
the arms of the See of Ely. But it was the
power that went with the state that bit into him,
the sitting in Westminster Hall as a Peer of the
realm, and framing laws for the good of the land.
Once Bishop of Ely (for he knew the archdeaconate
was but a step preparatory to that), who could
tell but the great See of Canterbury might be his
some day, and with it the Primacy of all England?
Primate of England, Adviser of the King. Ay!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>and more than Adviser, for when Kings were
weak and Primates strong, who, then, was the
true Ruler of the Realm? The great names of
the English Primacy rushed through his mind:
Theodore the monk of Tarsus, who had been
first to lift the throne of Canterbury above all
the others, and Dunstan, Abbot of Glastonbury,
and Anselm, Lanfranc, adviser to the Conqueror,
and Theobald and Thomas Beket, all men who
had shaped the policy of England as truly as ever
King had done. And once Primate of England,
who knew but a second Englishman might come
to sit in the chair of St. Peter? Even so, he the
poor student, arriving ten years before at Oxford
with not a groat in his possession and with only a
few rags to hide the garment of haircloth which
he had promised his mother to wear on Fridays
and fast-days, he the unknown student might rise
to be Vicar of Christ, Supreme Pontiff, Successor
of the Prince of Apostles! Stranger things than
that had happened&mdash;was not the present Pope,
Urban VI, but a coarse Italian peasant, Bartholommeo
Prignano by name? Was not the great
Hildebrand himself the son of a Tuscan carpenter?
The sons of carpenters had played a not
unimportant part in the history of the Church.</p>

<p>Pope! what tumultuous thoughts swept through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>him with the very name! What visions of Majesty,
of Power, of Imperial Might! The full title
he rolled upon his tongue: Bishop of Rome, Vicar
of Jesus Christ, Successor of the Prince of Apostles,
Supreme Pontiff of the Universal Church,
Patriarch of the West, Primate of Italy, Archbishop
and Metropolitan of the Roman Province,
Sovereign of the Temporal Dominion of the Holy
Roman Church.</p>

<p>Pope, Pappa, or <em>Father</em>. Even then there came
to him the recognition that, after all, that was the
proudest title of them all&mdash;Father of the People.
Protector! What could Archbishop or Primate
more than to obey that beautiful mandate of the
Saviour, "Feed my lambs"?</p>

<p>Indeed, too often had the Pope tried rather to
fleece them than to feed them, so that a Mediæval
wit was led to remark that the Papal staff
should be shaped as a pair of shears, rather than
as a shepherd's crook. But he, Robert Annys,
once Pope, he would enforce Reform, he would
bring back the Holy Spouse to its lost purity and
singleness of purpose; with his indomitable energy
he would wage a merciless war on that terrible
Antichrist, Robert of Geneva, who, under the
name of Clement VII, was holding shameful court
at Avignon. With relentless hand he would put
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>down Simony and Licentiousness; he would put
a stop to one prelate holding more than one See.
Above all, he would seek to spiritualize the
Church, so that men might know that temporal
power was not its true life, for, as the popular
song had it:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">

      <div class="verse">"Christ bad Peter keepe his sheepe,</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And yet other Popes had started with such
noble intentions. Who knows but perhaps the
man who holds a thousand thousand reins between
his fingers may not, in the end, find that,
instead of being the driver, he is really being
driven? There was the proudest Pope the world
knew, Gregory VII, the indomitable Hildebrand,
whose power seemed to have no bounds,&mdash;what
was his end? A lonely death in exile, with one
enemy crowned Emperor and another established
as his successor in the throne of Rome.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>
<p>The Bishop waited for his answer. He stood
at the parting of the ways. Clearly he must decide
without further delay. Perhaps this very
indecision was but a sign of the dangers of coming
within the spell of the Church. Perhaps this
stirring desire to keep within, this fierce ambition
which struggled in his breast for mastery, was
but a new temptation of the Evil One to lure him
into Vanity and a Love of Power for its own sake.
Oh, if only on the one side lay the path of perfect
right-doing, and on the other the path of evil-doing,
how easy were the decision. But, alas!
the devil works not in that way. He so mixes
up the good with the evil, and the evil with the
good, that one knows not which way to turn.</p>

<p>What should he answer to the Bishop? Was
he strong enough to stand alone, with only the
Bible in his hand, and say in the face of Bishops
and Archbishops, Cardinals, Legates, the Pope
himself: "Man needs not all these offices and
ceremonials, these stately places of worship, these
Bishops' palaces. Man should live by the Book
alone; then would there be no need for priests to
shrive or Popes to anathematize"? The Pope&mdash;the
people did not need him:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"What knoweth a tillour at the plow the popes name?"</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>
<p>He sought the answer in prayer. He implored
fervently for some miracle to show him the divine
way. Hours passed, and still he remained there
before the altar, bowed in prayer. The shadows
in the great interior changed places as the sun
travelled its course. Where in the morning the
sun had glorified great windows of painted glass,
there now rested cold gloom; what had stood out
white and clear now hid itself in shadow; a weird
procession of the Apostles and Virgins and Saints
took place, one after another silently emerging
from dim recesses, and after standing out for a
while white and clear-cut, slowly fading away into
the gray walls.</p>

<p>Still Annys prayed.</p>

<p>On the altar lay the Gospels beautifully bound
in gold. To the Book's ornamentation went
twenty sapphires, six emeralds, eight topazes,
eight salmandine stones, eight garnets, and twelve
pearls. Annys could not but think of the cheeks
he had seen that morning sunken from hunger.
He could not but reflect how many mouths those
jewels might have fed. His eyes fell upon the
cruet which contained the consecrated oil. It
was enclosed in an exquisitely jewelled reliquary
of finest silver gilt; the curtains of the altar were
of blue cloth of tissue, with images of the Crucifixion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>most delicately embroidered on it. Something
seemed to whisper within him that Jesus
Christ, could He now look on the condition of His
Church to-day, would not approve of all the splendor
within, while without men died by the hundred
for lack of brotherly service. He prayed
for light. How would Christ have acted? Would
He have been persuaded to take high office within
the Sanhedrim, and not go down among His people
who waited for Him? Surely not. Could all
the gilt and glory of Solomon's temple have made
Him forsake the cross? No, a thousand times
no! O for some manifestation of the divine
will that would make clear his way beyond peradventure!</p>

<p>"Grant it, dear Lord, for the sake of Thy Son
who died on the rood."</p>

<p>Far up over the altar, above the most beautiful
reredos in all England, stood the patient Christ
looking down upon him. On either side, slightly
lower, stood the solemn figures of Moses and
Elijah. The arches in which they stood were supported
by shafts of alabaster curiously entwined
with spiral belts of agates and crystals on a golden
ground. On the reredos was the sculptured story
of the wonderful life, the entry into Jerusalem,
washing the feet of the disciples, the Last Supper,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>the Agony in the Garden, and finally, Bearing
the Cross; yet the central figure of the Christ,
high up in its gable, easily dominated all. Majestic
as were the figures of the prophets, there
was a certain simpler majesty of the Christ that
appealed more intimately to the human soul.</p>

<p>The patient Christ looked down upon the kneeling
form, and to the tired eyes of the young priest,
it seemed that He smiled upon him. He saw the
gentle lips move and heard a low whisper:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Patience, dear son. Have I not pleaded with
My Father, 'Lord, Lord, I came not to earth,
that these great cathedrals be reared, nor that
superbly robed priests genuflect before My
image'?</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, I have faith that surely the time
will come when the hearts of the people are ripe for
the knowledge of Me. If the Lord hath seen to it
that the seeds of the flowers are blown by the
winds of heaven at the appointed time and scattered
into the fields that await their coming,
surely He will see that My words yet fall on fertile
soil."</p>

<p>Annys sprang to his feet, and gazing into the
face of the Christ, cried ecstatically:&mdash;</p>

<p>"But is the appointed time now come? Am I
the one to scatter the seed and cause it to fall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>upon the right soil? Oh, vouchsafe me a sign, a
sign, dear Lord, to show me the way."</p>

<p>For answer, softly there crept into the shadowed
apse the faint sound of voices, as of many men
chanting a hymn, but far, far away. Slowly it
gathered in strength until it touched the walls of
the great church and made them speak, ever growing
stronger and stronger until at last the words
could be distinguished, and the whole vast interior
rang with the refrain:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">"Jack Miller asketh help to turn his mill aright.</div>
      <div class="verse">He hath grounded small, small, small:</div>
      <div class="verse">The King's Son of Heaven He shall pay for all.</div>
      <div class="verse">Look thy mill go aright with the four sails,</div>
      <div class="verse">And the post stand with steadfastness."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And then the stirring call:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">"With right and with might</div>

      <div class="verse indent2">So goeth our mill aright."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The face of Annys was transfigured with joy,
for well he knew the song to be one that passed
from lip to lip among the followers of John Ball.
It was the call of the People, the defiant song
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>of the down-trodden, law-ridden, priest-ridden
People.</p>

<p>"A sign! a sign!" he cried exultantly, and
rushed out into the Square.</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>



<h2>V</h2>


<p>Where three roads from the neighboring villages
met, there was formed a great open space
in which a thousand or more persons could easily
find room without crowding. Here had gathered
together the people, eager to see and hear their
beloved leader, John Ball.</p>

<p>While Ball was resting at the tavern, after his
long tramp, the crowd amused itself welcoming
vociferously the late comers, cracking jokes, and
singing songs. A tall fellow made his way among
them, crying:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Busk ye, busk ye, John Ball hath rung your
bell. God do bote, for now is tyme."</p>

<p>"By my troth, then, it will be heard from one
end of England to the other!" exclaimed a powerfully
built, fierce-looking dyer, whose hands, stained
a purplish red by his trade, added to his sanguinary
appearance.</p>

<p>"'Tis fairly so. We shall yet all be free men,"
agreed a mild-mannered, lanky youth, with a slight
halt in his speech.</p>

<p>"Here come John the cobbler, and Will the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>tinker, both as sober as owls," called out a youngster.</p>

<p>"Ho, John, John, thy lass will turn a cold front
on thee, and thou smooth not the frown on thine
ugly phiz!" cried one who was blue with the cold,
and danced about first on one foot and then the
other to keep his blood circulating.</p>

<p>A short distance from him, a long-nosed,
peaked-faced chap, a bit unsteady on his legs, was
haranguing a group.</p>

<p>"Here's a nut to crack," he was saying; "who
can answer me this: What do the priests prefer
over Luke, Mark, and the Book?"</p>

<p>"Nay, then, not I," snarled one who was in no
mood for conundrums, "not I, seeing that I cannot
boast thy wit, Simon Lackless."</p>

<p>Lackless grinned broadly and placed one lean
finger to his long nose, waggishly. "Why, 'tis fair
enough," he said; "the priests do prefer Lucre to
Luke, Marks to Mark, and the Bag to the Book."</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! ha!" laughed the people about him,
passing the joke along from one to the other.</p>

<p>But Lackless had not overlooked the sneer; he
now pointed to the speaker and called out in a
loud voice, "Poor Wat! We must forgive him,
seeing he is so meek at home and must vent his
cooped-up spleen on some one!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>
<p>Wat sought another part of the crowd, discomfited.</p>

<p>"I wot a good saw," exclaimed an old man,
leaning heavily on a staff; "but there, do not
ask me for it, for my sides ache with laughing
a'ready."</p>

<p>But they would not let him off. "Come now,
let's have it," they begged. Some laughed outright
from sympathy with the old man's merriment.</p>

<p>"What think ye, what think ye&mdash;oh, Lord!"
he spluttered. "What think ye they do say at
Rome?"</p>

<p>"They do say 'Aves' in plenty, for all the good
they do us," grumbled one. But no one else ventured
to solve the riddle.</p>

<p>"Why, it is 'Give and it shall be given unto
you,'" the old man said, chuckling in his high,
cracked treble.</p>

<p>The crowd laughed heartily.</p>

<p>"Ay! 'and moch they take, and give but small,'"
sang out an impish lad, who had jumped on the
back of a comrade and was pummelling him
lustily.</p>

<p>"Aiee! Aiee!" cried the under one.</p>

<p>A wrathy butcher jerked the fellow off the
other's back and smacked him soundly for his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>pains. "Off with you! One would think a
mountebank was coming instead of John Ball!"</p>

<p>There were others who felt as he did. Beneath
all the fun there flowed an undercurrent of earnestness,
and many there were who spoke no
word, but gazed grimly before them, seemingly
lost in thought.</p>

<p>Suddenly some one started a song to while
away the time:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">"Earth out of earth is wonderfully wrought."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Others immediately joined in:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">"Earth from earth has got dignity of naught."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>When the last stanza was reached, six hundred
voices trolled it defiantly forth:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">"Earth upon earth would be a king;</div>
      <div class="verse">But how that earth shall be earth's thinks he no thing:</div>
      <div class="verse">Earth upon earth wins castles and towers,</div>
      <div class="verse">Then says earth unto earth 'this is all ours.'"</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Then a thin boyish treble started a mocking song
on the great state of the priests. They did not suffer
him to sing alone, but took it up eagerly with
him:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">"Priestes high on horse willeth ride</div>
      <div class="verse indent2">In glitterande gold of great array,</div>

      <div class="verse indent2">Change of clothing every day,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
      <div class="verse">With golden girdles great and small;</div>
      <div class="verse indent2">As boisterous as is beare at bay."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>But now John Ball was seen making his way
through the throng. As the people pressed together
to let him pass, benedictions and glances
of true affection followed him; and he, catching
sight here and there of some known face, nodded
cheerily, first on one side and the other. For the
people loved him, and called him "Saviour"; it
was only the Churchmen that spoke of him as
"the mad priest of Kent."</p>

<p>In the centre of the square stood a great tall
cross of stone with the head very beautifully
carved with a crucifix in the middle of leafage
work, and with wide stone steps, octagonal in
shape, leading to it. When Ball reached these
steps, he mounted to the very top and stood there
looking down with a quiet smile upon the upturned
faces before him. He stood there, a
powerfully built, tall, big-boned figure in the well-known,
reddish brown, coarse garb of his order, a
veritable tower of strength physical as well as
spiritual, and looking as if he knew his own
strength and gloried in it. A ring of dark hair
surrounded his priest's tonsure; his nose was big,
but clean-cut and with wide nostrils; his shaven
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>face showed a longish upper lip and a big but
blunt chin; his mouth was big and the lips closed
firmly. A face not very noteworthy but for the
gray eyes, well opened and wide apart, at times
lighting up his whole face with a kindly smile,
at times set and stern, or now and then resting
in that look as if they were gazing at something
a long way off, as do the eyes of the poet or
enthusiast.</p>

<p>Shout after shout broke from the throng as
he stood there calmly looking down upon them.
When at last there was silence, he was not suffered
to speak, for of a sudden a man standing immediately
next to the cross unfurled a banner which
swung out in the breeze. Only a smallish banner
with a peculiar device upon it: merely a picture
of a man and a woman rudely clad and with bare
legs and feet seen against a background of green
trees, the man holding a spade, the woman a distaff
and spindle, rudely enough drawn, yet with
great spirit and meaning. Underneath were the
written words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">"When Adam delved and Eve span</div>
      <div class="verse">Who was then the gentleman?"</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>A tremulous murmur arose that soon swelled
into a great huzza. The thrill of enthusiasm ran
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>like threads of fire from man to man. Again and
again, Huzza! Huzza!</p>

<p>A prosperous merchant, stopping curiously on
the edge of the crowd, pointed to the banner.
"That comes," he said, "of putting Holy Writ
'twixt the fingers of every swineherd."</p>

<p>His companion, an alderman from Norwich,
smiled. "Ah, can one wonder that they cry Ball
with Book and Bell? If they press the gospel
into daily life, there's no telling what will happen!"</p>

<p>Annys, coming from the dim twilight of the
Cathedral, looked about him at first in bewilderment.
He stood on the outer edge of the throng,
apart and gazing with interest at the scene. He
felt himself not yet attuned to the bright picture
before him, full of color and light and life. But
slowly the true significance of it all sank into him.
The very brightness and color of the scene was in
itself symbolic. Here all took place in the open
air; the sun, although near the end of its course,
yet threw into sharp contrast the dark fringe of
trees that encircled the outskirts of the cross-roads.
The air was pure and fresh and smelled of the sea
and the salt marshes, awakening every faculty
with a tingling sense of life and activity. It was
so different, ah, how different, from the heavy,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>incense-laden air of the dim Cathedral! That
was an atmosphere which dulled one's senses and
soothed them to sleep. The gay mass of moving
color as the people swayed this way and that, the
goodly brown soil, the living green of the earth,&mdash;how
good it all was! He could look up and see,
from where he stood, the stately tower of Ely and
the smaller tower of the Lantern etched grandly
against the sky. Beautiful as the proud Minster
was, even as he looked at it, he felt that its
power must wane from the moment that this
new religion of the poor priests took firm hold
of the people. The Cathedral stood for a religion
of secluded cloisters, a standard of living
for monks and priests; but Ball stood for a religion
for the whole broad earth, a standard of
living for the men and women who did the work
of the world.</p>

<p>And Ball spoke and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Fellow-men, a price is on my head. Well
wist I that even at this moment the Archbishop's
men are awaiting until I come into their power
to clap me into Maidstone gaol."</p>

<p>A threatening murmur ran through the crowd,
and many a man fingered his bow, and such as
had them, clapped hand to sword or studied the
points of their daggers fondly.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>
<p>"Yea, that wist I&mdash;there be but little time
left me to talk to you, so I must hasten. The
men of Kent have sent for me, and I am on my
way to them, although I doubt if I can have
speech with them before the gaolers have me in
irons. Yet the men have need of me, and I go.
I am not the first preacher of God's word to be
hunted by tyrants. Was not our dear Lord,
Jesus Christ, summoned again and again to appear
before the authorities to defend Himself on
the charge of disturbing the public peace? Was
not likewise the Apostle Paul persecuted? And
there were others, but it is not of them that I
came to speak to you to-day. I come to tell ye
wherein I am a disturber of the public peace,
wherein I am justly dubbed a 'pestilent fellow,'
as Ananias the high priest dubbed Paul. Yea,
verily, I am a pestilent fellow of the sect of the
Nazarenes, going about the land sowing the
seeds of discontent and rebellion. And I take
glory unto myself for the name. For surely if
ye bide content with such a lot as yours&mdash;if ye
remain satisfied with homes of wattled reeds and
mud, and do not rebel that oxen and horses
should be better cared for than such as were
made in the image of God,&mdash;then would ye not
deserve the name of Men. The people are growing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>tired of calling upon the high priests of the
Church to reform themselves. My brethren, the
time hath come when Reform must come from
below and not above, must come from the people
and no Pope. The people are not schismatic, the
people are not over-luxurious."</p>

<p>A sardonic grin swept over many faces, and some
broke out into loud guffaws at this sally.</p>

<p>"The people are not covetous, nor greedy, nor
lustful, nor ever grasping for new powers. Nay,
verily, I ask you to listen to the words of the
Apostle Paul, and tell me who come nearer to
the ideal held up therein&mdash;the priests or the
people?</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"'And behold, we live; as chastened and not killed; as
poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet
possessing all things.'"</p></div>

<p>"The people, the people," they shouted lustily.</p>

<p>"Ha!" cried one fellow to another, "of the
priests we may well say&mdash;they live, as unchaste
and lively; as rich, yet making others poor; as
having everything, and yet wishing more."</p>

<p>"In truth!" answered his companion; "but
stay, he begins again."</p>

<p>"The people," went on Ball, "seek Christ, but
they are a-weary of seeing Religion walk in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>market-place, a buyer among buyers, a ruler among
rulers, a tyrant among tyrants."</p>

<p>"That's true as Holy Writ," shouted one great fellow,
enthusiastically, and many took up the cry:&mdash;</p>

<p>"As true as Holy Writ!"</p>

<p>"The people desire priests who will come among
them and work among them, even as did the
Apostles. Why am I put beyond the pale of the
Church save that, instead of concerning myself with
unravelling the tangles of canonical lore, I seek to
unravel the tangles of life? Sure all that is needed
to do priestly service is to love much, for hath not
St. John said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"'He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there
is none occasion of stumbling in him'?</p></div>

<p>"And what is love, I ask ye, but good-fellowship?
Ah, cherish that word fellowship, my brethren,
for without fellowship be assured Christ cannot
enter among you: for without fellowship every
one standeth for his own lusts, and the strong
wax yet stronger, and the weak are pressed to
the wall and grow yet weaker and die. But
where fellowship entereth among you there entereth
Christ also&mdash;the strong shares his strength
with the weak, and the oppressed arise and lift
up their heads. We are told much, fellow-men,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>of the states of heaven and hell, we are told of
the blessings of heaven and the horrors of hell;
but lay it well to heart what I tell you,&mdash;friendship
is heaven and lack of fellowship is hell&mdash;fellowship
is life, and lack of fellowship is death.
In hell, one shall cry on his fellow to help him,
and shall find that therein is no help because
there is no fellowship, but every man for himself.
Therefore I tell you that the proud, despiteous
rich man, though he knoweth it not, is in hell
already, because he hath no fellow."</p>

<p>And his voice sank solemnly away and the
people brooded in silence over what they had
heard. And perhaps there came over the speaker
a sudden thought of the cold, dark dungeon
where he would soon lie chained, away from his
people whom he so dearly loved, away from the
open air and the sunlight and the shadows of
clouds sweeping over the fields. And his head
sank for an instant upon his breast, and as he
spoke again there was a slight tremble in his
voice, though he tried hard to throw it off:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Had I but kept my tongue between my
teeth I might have been some personage, if but
a parson of a town, and men would have spoken
well of me; and all this I have lost for the lack of
a word here and there to some great man, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>a little winking of the eyes amidst murder and
wrong and unruth. Now it is too late, the hemp
for me is sown and grown and heckled and spun."</p>

<p>"Nay, nay," a strong voice cried, "we shall
march upon the gaol and demand you of the
Archbishop himself. We shall come fifty thousand
strong, and we shall burst down the gaol if
he refuse us."</p>

<p>"His head shall yet decorate a post and you
shall live to see it," shouted another daring soul.
His remark was greeted with cheers.</p>

<p>Ball held up one hand for silence, a great light
of love irradiating his face.</p>

<p>"Ay, fear not that I have wrought all these
years in vain. For while the great tread down
the little, and strong beat down the weak, and
cruel men fear not, and kind men dare not, and
wise men can not, the saints in heaven bid me not
forbear. I wot well because of fellowship it will
not fail, though I seem to fail when the Archbishop
lays his hands on me. But in the days
hereafter shall I and my work yet be alive, and
men be holpen by them to strive again and yet
again."</p>

<p>And with his voice and demeanor grown solemn
once more with the thought of the long wait
which must be endured before they could come
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>together again, he uttered over them the same
beautiful benediction which had arisen centuries
before on the lips of Paul:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Now I beseech you, brethren, through the name of our
Lord Jesus Christ, that there be no divisions among you. Watch
ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong. Let
all that ye do be done in love."</p></div>

<p>Strong men were bowed in grief, and their
broad shoulders shook with sobs. The women and
children straggling about the outer edge of the
throng wept openly and long. But Robert Annys
rushed forward and, making his way to the foot
of the cross, flung himself there on his knees and
cried out passionately:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Nay, nay, John Ball, beloved master, fear not,
neither shall your work fail now, nor shall it seem
to fail. For from this moment I give myself to
it, body and soul. And I pledge myself to stand
in your place and do whatsoever you would have
me do while you are gone from us."</p>

<p>An astonished silence greeted these words, for
it had been pretty freely rumored that the archdeaconate
of Ely had been offered to the young
poor priest, and that he would never be able to
withstand the temptation to throw off the russet
sacking and don the albe and stole. When it was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>realized that the bribe of high office had not
caused him to desert the cause of the people, the
enthusiasm knew no bounds; men wrung their
neighbors' hands, and tears of joy ran down
bronzed cheeks. John Ball knew well that Robert
Annys was a man of great power and eloquence,
and he smiled gladly when he heard his
earnest words. He raised the young priest to his
feet, and clasped his hands warmly, and gazed
long and earnestly into his face. And the people
there assembled looked up at those two strong
souls standing united before the cross. And because
of that sight, they bade farewell to their
leader less sorrowfully than if they had none other
to look to for help and guidance.</p>

<h2>VI</h2>


<p>Into the Bishop's chamber the Legate entered,
smiling. There were many things in the turn of
events that went to make up his scarce concealed
satisfaction. To be sure, the times were troublous,
and a grave uneasiness was over the land,
yet to Pietro Barsini the end in view ever justified
the means, and there was no denying that the old
enemies of the Church, the Barons, were becoming
wonderfully meek and approachable under
the pressure of their present difficulties.</p>

<p>The discontent and threatened rising of the
people against their overlords had thrown the
Aristocracy&mdash;Bishops and Barons&mdash;into a union,
or semblance of union. Both were landowners,
and were absorbed in the problem of putting a
man behind the plough and keeping him there.
Untilled lands and rotting corn became of more
importance than Rights of Mortmains, Spiritualities,
Peter's Pence, Rights of Investiture, or
other trifling matters over which Churchmen and
Barons had quarrelled.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>
<p>Thus it came about that at that time for a brief
instance the lion lay down with the lamb. A true
Churchman, such as was Pietro Barsini, could find
much indeed to relish in the situation. Not only
was the mighty English Baronage turned from
an enemy into an ally, but there was the unregenerate
past to do penance for. Therefore rich gifts
and many altars and chantries and noble additions
to cathedrals began to find their way to the
Church from the repentant sinners. Many and
profitable were the Plenary and Special Indulgences
granted to undo the direful Past; and if
perchance to the contrite purchaser redemption
seemed to come a trifle high, a sight of his rotting
corn, or bleating sheep, or distressed kine, speedily
brought him to terms.</p>

<p>The Cardinal could find it in his heart almost to
love some of those hardy, obstinate Barons, his
new-found friends, but for the Bishop of Ely he
had only unmitigated scorn. He could understand
an out and out enemy, but these half enemies and
half friends, these Churchmen who are ever prating
of reform from within, and who one minute
are as fiercely denouncing the head of the Church,
as the next they are anathematizing the heretics
and would-be robbers of the Church,&mdash;these he
frankly could not understand at all. Thomas of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>Ely was his special detestation; he had no patience
with his absurd strictures regarding the conferring
of benefices only on worthy and pious Churchmen.
The Hierarchy in the eyes of the Nuncio
was a vast and powerful machine of intricate
workings. If one delicate part of the machine
refused to work, there must be plenty of oil to
lubricate it,&mdash;oil in the shape of emoluments was
vastly more important to the usefulness of the
machine than such abstract qualities as piety or
chastity. There were certain crowned heads to
be soothed, certain fierce Barons to be placated,
certain wily Counts to be won over, here and there
a Queen to be flattered, or a rival to be disposed
of at a safe distance; therefore there must be
benefices to bestow with wise discrimination, here
one in Sicily, there one in Burgundia, there one in
Flanders or in France, or maybe in England.</p>

<p>The Cardinal inquired most considerately into
the Bishop's state of health. His greeting was
as smooth and affable as ever, yet the Bishop
could read the malicious triumph that bubbled
beneath the calm surface.</p>

<p>"Too bad, too bad," began his visitor, in suave
tones, "that a hempen rope should be the end of
so promising a youth."</p>

<p>"How say you?" exclaimed the Bishop, startled.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>
<p>"I say that, though we thought so cannily to
have put salt on the tail of our bird, yet having
left him alone in the gilded cage, he hath found
it in his power to fly away."</p>

<p>The Bishop's dream-structure in which he had
just been wandering fell to the ground with a
crash. The thought of that beautiful youth by
his side, enthusiastic, eloquent, fearless, assisting
him, brightening his declining years, had been
very sweet. Momentarily he had been expecting
his arrival to be announced. And this was the
end of his hopes! He was too profoundly chagrined
not to show it.</p>

<p>"H'm!" he said, half to himself, "I had thought
to bring him home with me."</p>

<p>"Doubtless," insinuated the Cardinal Barsini,
"had he come to my Lord Bishop's hospitable
mansion, he would have found the cage altogether
too heavily gilded to have stirred his wings."</p>

<p>"He was deep in prayer. What could I?"</p>

<p>"Ill it behooves me to suggest. However it
might have been, since it is true that he hath
slipped from between our fingers, Holy Church
will have to limp along as best she can without
his valuable aid."</p>

<p>His listener winced at the irony, but returned
it with interest.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>
<p>"Tell me all about it, <em>you know all</em>," he said,
with quiet emphasis. For well it was known that
nothing happened in all the length and breadth
of the land without the cognizance of the Legate.
The "Pope's spy" the people nicknamed him.</p>

<p>"I know only that the mad priest whom you
have refused to place in irons, John Ball, appeared
yestere'en at the cross-roads, and as he had but
just arrived and never has been known to keep
his tongue long between his teeth, he straightway
gave one of his seditious, incendiary harangues
(though he doth call them sermons), urging his
hearers to hold together against the just decrees
of Parliament and the King's&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know, I know," interrupted the Bishop, impatiently,
"I know all you would say against this
Ball, for I have heard it many times; but tell me
what did take place that concerns this young
Annys."</p>

<p>The Legate's beady eyes snapped. "And it
befell that the young protégé of your Reverence
was among those that listened," he concluded.</p>

<p>"Ah!" exclaimed the Bishop, with a long-drawn-out
sigh. Well he knew how strong an influence
such a man as Ball would have upon the high-spirited
young priest just at that point in his
career.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>
<p>"And then just as Ball bade them all farewell,
and announced that he was walking straight
into the arms of the Archbishop's men at Kent,
this hot-head of ours boldly flings himself from
out the crowd, and throwing himself at Ball's feet,
proclaims himself Ball's successor, and swears
eternal allegiance to the Cause."</p>

<p>The Bishop groaned aloud: "Why are they so
misguided as to persecute this Ball? It will cost
Sudbury his head, this action, mark my words.
If they clap him into gaol he will but come forth
stronger than ever. Can they not or will they
not see that their methods of repression are but
heaping fuel on the fire? Can they not or will
they not see that all may yet come well without
violence, if their leaders are not suppressed, if
there be talkings and gatherings, ay! and marchings
if they will? The people have some just
grievances, though, to be sure, they are greatly
and criminally exaggerated; but let them talk of
them, and, mark me, they will not bite near so
deep. Let me tell you, and the Primate of England,
ay! and the King himself, that the people
are now in a mood to accept small concessions;
let this go farther, and persecute them more, and
thrones may tremble ere they cry 'Enough!'"</p>

<p>"What concessions?" asked the Legate, angrily.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>"Make concessions to the wild, turbulent
mob that, given its way, will yet plant a burning
torch on every palace and castle in the land!"</p>

<p>"Nay," gently interposed the Bishop, "it is to
prevent such a rebellion that I would make just
concessions <em>now</em>."</p>

<p>"<em>Just</em> concessions, indeed! Basta!"</p>

<p>"Ay," reiterated the Bishop, "<em>just concessions</em>!
For it is true that the wages doled to the workers
are scarce enough to keep body and soul together,
and the Poll Tax, which hath been taken three
times these past four years, falls heavier upon the
very poor than any others. For well is it known
that the rich have an argument in their purse
that goeth straightway to the heart of the tax-gatherer.
And mark me, my friend, you may
think the people get used to the raping of their
women by these same insolent tax-gatherers and
sheriffs and King's men, as eels get used to being
skinned. But, after all, praise to the Most High,
man made in the image of God is not an eel.
The nobles cannot hope to go on with impunity
treading down the most sacred rights of human
beings. For the spark of divinity in man cannot
let him remain long at the level of beasts; and it
is a spark that neither you nor Baron can quite
stamp out, because it is from God."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>
<p>The old man paused, and rested for a moment
with his head on his hands as if weary and discouraged;
but the Legate paced up and down
angrily, holding his arms tightly folded before
his breast, as if to shut in the bitter words that
rose within him. When the old man spoke again
it was at first gently, and slowly, and then, as his
indignation voiced itself, the words came bubbling
up hot from him, faster and faster.</p>

<p>"Do you not see," he said, "that the greatest
danger is to be apprehended from a martyr? It
was the worship of the martyrs in the secret Catacombs
that knit firmly together the bones of young
Christianity. Could the Holy Catholic Church
ever have grown into the most powerful body in
the world, had it from the very first been fed on
opulence and power?"</p>

<p>"Yea, I have heard," sneered the Legate, trying
hard to hide his rage, "that the Bishop of Ely
holds it Christlike to stir up the people against
all authority."</p>

<p>The Bishop's face grew cold and hard. "On
the contrary," he began severely, "I deprecate the
teachings of Ball just so far as they give rise to
rebellion and disorder. I hold that the people
are not ready to rule themselves; I firmly believe
that were the mandates of Ball to be obeyed there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>would follow disruption and chaos, for I remember
the words of Paul:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"'I fed you with milk, not with meat, for ye were not yet
able to bear it; nay, not even now are ye able; for ye are yet
carnal, for there is among you jealousy and strife.'</p></div>

<p>"I hold that the people should be fed for yet a
while with milk. I hold that they are not yet
ready to bear meat; yet, Pietro Barsini, that is
precisely what Ball is feeding them with. He is
giving them strong meat whether they can bear
it or no. Beware, Pietro Barsini, beware, for the
time is coming when, once having tasted of the
meat, they shall no longer remain satisfied with
the milk, and, when it is held to their lips, they
shall turn from it. When that time comes, look
you, look you to it well, for the foundations on
which such as you rest will crumble away, and not
so much as one stone shall remain."</p>

<p>Exhausted by his vehemence, the old man's
head fell wearily on his breast, and the Italian
stole noiselessly away.</p>

<h2>VII</h2>


<p>When Robert Annys was announced, a message
was sent to him, bidding him be a guest at
dinner, which was just on the point of being served,
and promising him private audience immediately
after. So he waited in one of the stately apartments
of the superb palace, and looked on the
walls and ceilings, all wainscoted with oak so
carefully chosen that the better part of a forest
must have been sacrificed to it, and on the rich
tapestries and hangings, and wondered that those
calling themselves servants of God should be
housed in palaces of brick and stone with ten
windows to a front and three stories, one on the
other, while those to whom they ministered in the
name of Christ were huddled together in miserable
huts of clay with roofs of moss or turf.</p>

<p>His host did not keep him waiting long. Almost
immediately after he had cordially greeted
his guest, the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maître d'hôtel</i> announced dinner,
and the strangely mated couple made their way
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>to the Great Hall. The Bishop staked a good
deal upon the surroundings in which Annys now
found himself. He counted upon a certain refined
delicacy that he noted in the poor priest, a sensitiveness
to environment that would make him
respond to the luxury and elegance about him.
He hoped that Annys might reflect that all this
power and wealth might be his if he would but
stretch forth his hand, and that thereby the influence
of the scene at the cross-roads might yet be
overcome. But the Bishop was too late; a few
hours before, and it might have seemed a goodly
thing to Robert Annys to entertain in this lordly
fashion, it might have seemed a Christly thing to
toss discarded crusts and broken pieces of meat
into a jewelled bowl that its contents might be
thrown to the beggars clamoring before the gate;
but now a higher conception of Christliness mastered
him. He had been too profoundly moved
at the cross-roads, the whole scene had come to
him too directly as the answer of God to his prayer,
for him to respond readily to what went on about
him. Instead, a profound disgust seized upon him,
a bitter contempt for this kind of Christianity, so
that he could scarce restrain himself from rising
and openly rebuking the Bishop for all this unseemly
pomp and splendor.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>
<p>They sat at the raised, or great table as it was
called, facing the other tables, which were set
longitudinally, and which were only boards laid
upon trestles so that they could easily be removed
to permit the floor to be spread with fresh rushes
after the evening meal. These rushes served as
a bed for all who assembled there, for the hospitality
of my Lord Bishop was never questioned.
Let merchants, priests, jesters, clerks, scholars
from Oxford, or mummers, all lie there and welcome;
to-morrow the tables would be set up again
with plenty for all.</p>

<p>Before anything was brought in to eat, a liveried
fellow knelt before each guest at the high table,
holding a beautiful silver ewer filled with scented
water into which to dip the hands, followed by
another fellow similarly liveried who passed a soft
linen napkin upon which to dry them. Then came
trenchers of fresh white bread on which to place
their meat, the folk below at the long tables
receiving only the ordinary trenchers of wood
which could be scraped to serve for many meals.
Looking at these trenchers, Annys thought sadly
of the miserable, coarse, black bread made of
beans or coarsely pounded oats that must answer
for the poor. And he thought of the sweat
with which even such poor stuff must be earned.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>Pondering over all this, the delicate sole, found
only on the tables of the great, the fine almonds,
the roasted figs, and colored sugar-plums seemed
to choke him. His Piers must content himself
with a dish of herrings and onions, and perhaps
an infrequent bit of cheese, or still less frequent
scrap of meat. He bethought him of how that
great-hearted poet of the Malvern Hills had cried
out that all mischief proceeds from the clergy,
who ought to set an example of holy poverty,
and who rather emulated the splendor of knighthood:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Now is religion a rider, a buyer of land as though he were a
lord."</p></div>

<p>The Bishop, reading nothing of what was going
on in the poor priest's mind, now bent toward
him courteously and sought to fix his attention
upon the luxury and elegance of the banquet.
He deprecated to him the fact that, as it was a
fast-day, he was unable to offer more bountiful
hospitality. Annys could scarce restrain a smile
at the ingenuity of the cook, who certainly might
well have shone in a clerkly career, so well did he
know how to obey the letter and ignore the spirit.</p>

<p>For, first there was served to each guest, on
being seated, a quarter of a pint of grenache.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>Then came roast apples with white sugar-plums
on them, roasted figs, sorrel, watercress, and rosemary.
Then a soup made of trout, tenches, white
herring, fresh-water eels, whiting, almonds, ginger,
saffron, cinnamon powder, and sweetmeats. This
was followed by soles and salmon for salt-water
fish; and pike with roe, carps, and breams for
fresh-water fish should they be preferred. Besides
all this there were side dishes of oranges and
apples, and rice with fried almonds upon it.</p>

<p>Fast-day forsooth! Was there not epitomized
herein the very condition into which the Church
of Christ had fallen, its true life blighted in the
killing frost of ritualism?</p>

<p>When the last sugar-plum had been passed by
the servitors, and the chairs and benches were
shoved somewhat back from the boards, and all
sat about in easy postures, the harpist up in the
beautiful oriole played sweet music. A youth
with a treble of thrilling sweetness sang to them
of the uncertainty of this life, for the Bishop permitted
no ribald love songs to be sung in his hall.
Then there followed a hymn to Jesus Christ:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">"With noble meat He nourished my kind</div>
      <div class="verse indent2">for with His flesh He would me feed.</div>
      <div class="verse">A better food may no man find,</div>
      <div class="verse indent2">for to lasting life it will us lead."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>After this came a psalm of David, set to a quaint
and plaintive air; but the Bishop, now perceiving
that his guest was ill at ease, summoned a servant,
and throwing him a purse of gold to be
divided among the minstrels, bade Annys follow
him to his solar.</p>

<p>Annys did so with Piers' complaint of the great
Churchmen of the day ringing in his ears:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">"With change of many manner meats,</div>
      <div class="verse indent2">With song and solos sitting long,</div>

      <div class="verse">And each man mote him lords call."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>When they reached the Bishop's private chamber,
Thomas of Ely laid his hand kindly upon the
young man's head.</p>

<p>"My son," he said, "I have heard. Would to
God it were otherwise, but I hear that thou hast
seen a light and must follow it."</p>

<p>Annys bowed his head gravely. Then, suddenly
throwing himself upon his knees before the
Bishop, he exclaimed in a broken voice:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Father, I have chosen the difficult way. Help
me that my feet do not falter."</p>

<p>The old man was deeply moved, and stooped
and embraced the young priest, who began:&mdash;</p>

<p>"After the Mass in the Cathedral, I lay a long
while before the altar in prayer. I knew not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>whither to turn. All that you had said to me
with such powerful eloquence I argued over again
and again. All that had drawn me to the work
of my master John Wyclif also passed again and
again through my mind. I do not know how long
I lay there on the cold stones, I know only that
when I went out into the open, the tops of the
pines were draining the last dregs of the red
sun."</p>

<p>He paused for an instant, and then, looking
earnestly into the prelate's face, "I preached a
goodly sermon, did I not so?" he asked abruptly.</p>

<p>"Never before did I listen to one more timely,
nor one that stirred me more profoundly."</p>

<p>"Yea, I felt that. See, I hide naught from you.
Yet, Father, I did not feel glad that it was given
me to help others that heard me, rather was I
puffed up with pride that <em>I</em> could so speak, that <em>I</em>
could so touch and sway others. There stirred
within me all the forces of Pride, and Love of
Power for its own sake, which are the favorite
minions of Satan."</p>

<p>"Ah! my son, my son!"</p>

<p>"The mighty Minster with all its wealth of
associations, with all its noble and splendid
beauty, the pageantry and glory of the Mass,
Father, the pulsations of the glorious organ,&mdash;all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>overpowered me with a flood of self-worship.
The future rose before me full of pomp and glory.
I saw myself rise step by step within the Church
until not one step remained above me. Not one
step. I saw myself enthroned on the chair of the
Apostle, I saw before me as in a vision the waiting
throng in the vast plaza before St. Peter's, I
heard the chanting of the Papal choir, I caught
sight even of the glittering troops lining the
plaza, I heard the boom of the cannons of St.
Angelo firing their grand salute, and I rose up
and blessed the great concourse that knelt before
me. Oh, at that moment I cared naught for
those people, naught for their spiritual needs;
I cared only for my own aggrandizement, my own
overwhelming power. Surely, then, if ever, were
the spirits battling for my soul&mdash;the powers of
darkness and the powers of light. The evil spirits
whispered to me that I was born for power,
that I was able to sway and lead men; but the
gentle spirits asked me wherefore had I forsaken
Christ Jesus.</p>

<p>"And then, Father, I prostrated myself and put
my whole soul into a prayer for guidance. I
implored God to grant me a sign to show me the
Way of Everlasting Life."</p>

<p>"Would to God I might have been with thee,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>that I might have proved to thee the Way led
within the Church."</p>

<p>"Father, that sign was vouchsafed me."</p>

<p>"Ah!"</p>

<p>"Yea, faintly there came borne in upon me,
kneeling there, the sound of singing. At first I
took it for the sound of angels' voices, but as it
grew in strength I knew it to be the sound of
many men singing, and at last I could make out
the words, and I hearkened with all my heart, for
clearly it was the voice of the Lord speaking
through the people."</p>

<p>"And what was it that you heard?"</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">"'Jack the Miller asketh help to turn his mill aright.</div>
      <div class="verse indent2">He hath grounden small, small, small.'"</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>"Ay!" cried the Bishop, "the song of the
followers of John Ball." For a moment both
remained in silence, thinking over the words of
the song, and then the poor priest went on with
his recital:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I sprang to my feet, scarce offering more than
a hurried prayer of thanks that the answer had
been vouchsafed me, and dashed out and followed
the people who were running to the cross-roads,
and there I did witness a wonderful sight&mdash;nigh
unto a thousand men with some women and children
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>gathered there to hear this John Ball, who
spake to them from the steps of the stone cross."</p>

<p>"And what spake he?"</p>

<p>"Of fellowship, always of fellowship. He
spake of the injustice of the rich and powerful,
yet he did not try to set the poor against the rich
as his enemies say he doth, but rather he told
them that the rich should envy the poor, for to
the poor is given fellowship which is denied the
rich."</p>

<p>"Yea!" exclaimed the Bishop, "I doubt not
that this Ball is sincere enough. He thinks he
hath right on his side, yet once let the gold of the
rich pour into the laps of the poor, and they will
see that not only do they not use it better, but less
well. My son, many are the virtues praised and
glorified by men like Ball, which are, after all,
but the virtues that come with poverty, which is
a state of far less temptation than that of great
riches. Have a care, have a care, my son, lest the
poor are roused to grasp the sceptre from the rich
before they are trained to wield it worthily. Have
a care, if this evil day arise; it is what thy master
John Wyclif hath warned thee against."</p>

<p>The pupil of the great scholar of Balliol for
an instant hung his head, then he raised it and
looked full at the Bishop. "I know well there is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>danger," he said gravely, "and it will be my
solemn duty to preach temperance and control
to these people, to show the world that we are
united in love of justice and not greed for wealth
and high estate. Yet, Father, it is now clear to
me that, did our Lord come to earth to-day, He
would be found on the side of the rustics."</p>

<p>The Bishop had no doubt of it. He did not
care, however, to give expression just then to
his innermost conviction, that, had not the Holy
Catholic Church wandered afar from the teachings
and example of its Founder, there had been
no Church Universal.</p>

<p>So it befell that when Robert Annys set out
on his mission the blessing of the Bishop went
with him:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"'<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Pax Domini sit semper vobiscum</span>.'</p></div>

<p>"Go, my son, and may the grace of God be with
you and the spirit of the Holy Ghost!"</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>



<h2>VIII</h2>


<p>One day near unto a hundred years before the
birth of Robert Annys, Sir Humphrey Sculton
found himself in the middle of the river Trent,
with his good horse struggling under him against
the icy flood that was rushing down upon them,
and carrying them always farther and farther from
the ford. Sir Humphrey's distress was not relieved
by the sight of the neglected bridge which should
have borne him safely from shore to shore, but to
whose crumbling stones he had not dared trust himself.
While in this dire predicament, it is related
by himself, he swore a great round oath that by
Our Lady in Heaven if ever he should see again
his castle and his good wife Eleanor smiling down
upon him from the terrace, he would not only
repair the bridge which the lazy monks had allowed
to rot, but he would erect upon it a fine
chapel to the Virgin, that all passers-by and wayfarers
might appreciate her protection and seek
after it. So, straightway the force of the flood
having been miraculously stopped, and the horse
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>having found its way without further difficulty to
the ford, and borne its master in safety to the opposite
shore, the knight was as good as his word;
and across the river he caused to be built a fine
bridge of stone of nine arches, while on its east
end arose the beautiful chapel of the Holy Virgin.</p>

<p>But, notwithstanding this eminent example of
piety and service to mankind, the end of the fourteenth
century again saw the bridge fallen into
sad disrepair, those having received the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pontagium</i>,
or right of bridge toll, having been well
content to collect it, together with the offerings
to the Holy Virgin, without stirring hand or foot
to put the pennies to use. There were now places
where the deep ruts made by the heavy carriages
and carts had worn through almost to the very
last inch of stone; indeed, here and there one
might peer between the loosened cobbles and see
the gray water flowing beneath.</p>

<p>Many were the petitions sent to the King, complaining
that "this one, Adam Fenere, warden
of the Chapel of the Holy Virgin, received and
took away all manner of offerings and alms, without
doing anything for the repair of the bridge or
the said chapel as he was bound to do."</p>

<p>The parson of the neighboring church protested
that it seemed hurtful to God and to Holy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>Church that offerings should be appropriated by
any one except the parson within whose parish the
chapel is found. Wherefore he prayed "for God
and Holy Church and for the souls of our lord
the King's father and his ancestors, that he may
have the keeping of the said chapel annexed
to his church, together with the charge of the
bridge." And he further promised "that he will
take heed with all care to maintain them well, for
the profit and honor of Holy Church, to please
God and all the people passing that way."</p>

<p>To this strange medley of the human and the
divine the King made his usual cautious reply,
"<span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Ly roi s'avisera</span>," for this Adam was not without
powerful friends at court; and, before the matter
was satisfactorily adjusted, there came along
this bridge one day a short, rotund traveller who,
although in pilgrim's garb, yet rode a most excellent
mount. This fellow drew in his rein and
looked in frank amazement at certain clear signs
of repair which were going on about him.</p>

<p>"What then! by Our Lady, hath the old skinflint
yonder of his own free will taken to yield
some of the silver from his maw, or hath he been
forced to?"</p>

<p>"Nay," replied one of the laborers, pausing for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>an instant in the placing of a heavy stone, "Nay,
trust Adam Fenere not to give up aught of what
is once between his fingers; nay, 'tis him yonder
that did set us all working, 'tis him yonder."</p>

<p>The pilgrim looked in the direction indicated,
and was surprised to see a poor priest, of delicate
build and saintly aspect, of the kind that attracts
women to the bosom of the Church (or, as this
fellow Stott was accustomed to put it, to the
bosom of the Churchman), who yet was directing
the work of repair with great vigor, even carrying
and placing stones that seemed all too heavy
for his strength.</p>

<p>"H'm, h'm," murmured the pilgrim to himself.
"Seems better fitted to be a boudoir saint than
a builder of bridges."</p>

<p>"Good morrow," he cried to the poor priest,
who now looked up wearily from his task, pressing
a lean hand to his brow, "good morrow!
How comes it, Sir Russet-priest, that I find you
doing this work? Surely those hands have been
accustomed rather to the turning of the pages of
a breviary than to the placing of stones."</p>

<p>The young poor priest flushed deeply, and
there shot from his eyes that flash which in certain
men is more compelling than the flash of
steel; yet he answered quietly, "I do the work of
my Master, wheresoever it leads me."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>
<p>"And do you hold the building of bridges in
greater repute than the saying of Aves, or is
it mayhap that you wish to become a famous
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pontiff</i>?" the fellow chuckled.</p>

<p>The play upon words evoked no smile from the
earnest young poor priest, whose retort, however,
waited not an instant. "Nay, but I find the land
overflowing with those who will say 'Hail Marys'
from Matin to Vespers, but I do not find over
many ready to cut stones and repair the highways."</p>

<p>"Why not get down and help us?" asked one
burly fellow of the traveller. "Wot you that the
Bishop hath granted sixty days' indulgence to all
who do the pious work of repairing roads or
bridges?"</p>

<p>The fat pilgrim shook with laughter. "Water
will freeze in May," he answered, "before you see
Hugo Stott laboring in the highroad. And as
for remittances of penances," he pointed significantly
to the vernicle sewed conspicuously in
his cap to show that he had but lately returned
from a pilgrimage to Rome, "you see," he said,
"I have seen somewhat of the world at the same
time, and I have taken it leisurely and without
toil, and, moreover, the Roman ladies are beautiful
and complaisant." Then, catching sight of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>the scorn in the eyes of the poor priest, he hastened
to add, "Besides, I am bent upon more
important business, for what would the people do
were I to fail them?"</p>

<p>"Fail them in what?" indignantly asked Robert
Annys&mdash;for the bridge repairer was he. "To
my mind you fail them indeed if you scorn to
help them in keeping in repair the one means
they have of communicating with one another, of
hearing of one another and keeping up the bonds
of fellowship."</p>

<p>"Well," replied the other, good-humoredly, "I
do my share in keeping the roads in repair&mdash;thou
in one way, I in another."</p>

<p>"How now," exclaimed Annys, fiercely; "I do
not jest."</p>

<p>"Nor I. Nothing is simpler. Take a man
who hath been ordered to make a pilgrimage to
Rome, or even let us say Canterbury, I pardon
him his pilgrimage at the expense of a few shillings,
and by my help he hath at once saved his
immortal soul and the road which he would have
worn by his feet."</p>

<p>"And you thereby have lined your pouch with
the shillings," said Annys, more amiably, for, much
as he detested these pardoners who were living off
the ignorance and superstition of the people, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>could not resist a smile at the fellow's quaint
logic.</p>

<p>"Ay! 'Tis an equal division. I take the pence
and they get the peace. I do the wandering and
endure the hardships of travel" (here he could
not help a grimace as he saw the other's keen
eyes fixed pointedly on the finely groomed horse
with the luxurious trappings, a mount that scarce
spoke very eloquently of hardships). "See," he continued,
pointing to the various signs and amulets
which hung in great profusion about his neck,
"see, here are the ampullæ from Canterbury, and
this scallop shell I got all the way from the shrine
of St. James in Galicia; and you see I must hunt
up relics and medals from all parts of the world,
while they bide peaceably at home and derive all
the benefits from them."</p>

<p>There was something in the russet priest, notwithstanding
his clear displeasure, that attracted
the pardon seller. "See here, Sir Russet-priest,"
he began, approaching nearer and lowering his
voice, "be thou not so sour-faced, young man.
Thou hast thy way of bringing blessings to the
people, and I have mine. And thou must grant
that we pardoners have our uses. You long-visaged
chaps may do more to uplift the people as ye
call it, but drat me if ye leave them so merry as I."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>
<p>"Ay! God wot, they have little enough to make
them merry," groaned Annys.</p>

<p>"I satisfy the cravings of their souls by the
transfer of a bit of sow's ear, or a few drops of
calf's blood&mdash;so be it&mdash;or a bit of riband or a
bead or two, and I go my way singing. And I
come not with long face to prate of the devil and
hell-fire, but of jollity and pleasaunce, and if perchance
they will none of my relics, I am at no loss,
either, for I have here in my bag what all good
wives love," and he put one pudgy hand into the
huge bag which hung on his saddle, and drew
forth a couple of shining knives and some bright
necklaces of cheap beads and a gauntlet or two.</p>

<p>"If so it chance that I meet with a customer
that is not likely to be caught on the side of his
soul, you see I am ready at a turn of the hand to
land him with the needs of his body."</p>

<p>There came into the poor priest's mind what
was commonly rumored of these peddling pardoners,
how no maid was safe with them. Even
then he noted the man's lascivious mouth, which
parted to show ugly, yellow fangs, and the bloated
body which spoke of every excess, the small roving
eyes and the heavy knot of red eyebrows that
met over them, the coarse, knobby nose with red
and purple veins running through it and a great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>wart on one side,&mdash;a face for maids to shrink
from.</p>

<p>And this man shrived sinful souls!</p>

<p>"How long, how long, O Lord!" he cried, as
he watched the man ride away.</p>

<p>But before he was quite out of sight, the fellow
turned and called, "I shall see thee at the Stourbridge
Fair, doubtless," and Annys nodded an
impatient yes, and resumed his labors, although
already he staggered from fatigue.</p>

<p>But to stagger from a fatigue that was purely
physical was a joy to Robert Annys. Often worn
and unstrung from the sense of the awful responsibility
that was upon him, he would plunge recklessly
into some physical labor that was severe
enough to absorb his every energy. Physical
labor became his anodyne to the growing unrest
and despair that was in his heart. In the task
which he had taken up he suffered even as the
Bishop had foretold. He never questioned the
righteousness of his decision, he never faltered in
his work, no matter how it taxed his slight store
of strength, so long as he was upheld by the knowledge
that it helped the Cause to which he had
given his life. It was only when discouraged by
the ignorance and folly and cruelty of those whom
he hoped to serve that he questioned his own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>power to accomplish good. During the nine
months that had followed since he had stepped
into Ball's place, again and again had he been
utterly cast down by the terrible dread that the
actual Uprising would take place before the peasants
were ready for it. And two dire results were
ever in his mind: the one, that whatever would
be gained would be lost again through lack of
wise leadership and self-restraint; the other (and
this became an almost daily horror to him as he
watched the humor of the rustics daily growing
blacker and blacker), that the few wise and true
men who were working for an Ideal would be
swept aside when the Uprising came, by the fierce
and unruly majority, by men who had nursed their
wrongs until they were no longer of the right
mind, men who would wreak a fearful vengeance
when their time should come.</p>

<p>However, there had not been much time
wasted in wondering or prophesying, for there
had been much to do. The people welcomed
him eagerly everywhere; and before he had done
speaking at one village, he had learned of another
where they awaited him anxiously. And so he
had tramped manfully along the highway, his
valiant spirit making him press on often when
the other travellers whom he encountered gave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>way before floods and snows. At times, he too
was forced to yield when the storms rendered the
roads utterly impassable, and he had known
many a slow-footed day pass over his head while
he waited impatiently at some wayside tavern,
and looked out with anxious eyes at the snow
falling and imprisoning him far from those that
looked for him and counted on him. At such
moments of dreary inaction it was that his fears
for the future weighed heaviest.</p>

<p>Wherever he came, he brought news of the
Uprising, and spoke of the great rendezvous at
Blackheath for which all must get ready to stand
before the King and tell him of their sore straits.
There was something pitiful in the unquestioning
faith which they all held that, their situation
once known to their King, he could not but set
them free. That a King could be unkingly did
not enter their simple, trusting hearts. To the
men in all the realm, to those of Kent as well as
to those of Essex, to those of Suffolk as well as
to those of Norfolk, the great plain at Blackheath
was spoken of as the great rallying-place. To
the men of those counties where they fared somewhat
better than the others, he spoke of the dire
needs of their fellow-brethren in some distant
county, and how they must all hold together and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>take up the cause of those that were less fortunate
than they. To those that were the most
miserable of all, he spoke of their brethren of
other parts of the land, who were going to help
and uphold them. And so from village to village
and county to county he went, always knitting
closer the bonds of fellowship. For a while
the Hierarchy had looked on and bided its time.
Yet sooner or later it was obliged to strike a
blow at this defiant poor priest who preached a
doctrine fatal to the interest of the Holy Roman
Church, and, moreover, who heartened the peasants
in their absurd mutterings against their
rightful overlords. Already the Barons were
growing restive that the Church should move
so slowly. If the powerful Hierarchy could
not crush a dangerous sedition-stirring russet
priest like this, then of small use was their costly
ally.</p>

<p>So with all due pomp and ceremony at St.
Peter's in Rome, the Anathema against Robert
Annys, poor priest, had been duly launched by
twelve Cardinals surrounding the Pope upon his
throne. The solemn bells tolled as at a death, and
all the Cardinals cast their lighted candles upon
the ground as they cried "Fiat" to the mandate
of their chief. Then the acolytes trampled upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>the candles and extinguished their lights, even as
the soul is extinguished that dwells in hell.</p>

<p>Annys had been filled with indignant scorn.
"They would excommunicate Christ Himself, did
He come upon the earth to-day!" he said bitterly.
There was something horrible to him in
the fact that the head of the present Church of
Christ should cast a soul into perdition for going
among the people and following the clear example
and mandates of Him whom the Church
still had the effrontery to call its Founder!
What heresy had he been guilty of? He had
but obeyed St. Paul, who put love above all
else.</p>

<p>Love broke down many barriers, and solved
many problems. What question, for instance,
compared in importance in Mediæval days with
the great controversy over the Treasury of the
Church? Did or did not the Founder of Christianity
mean what He said when He commanded
that none should take heed of the morrow?</p>

<p>Upon this hung the establishments of sects,
monasteries, entire orders, and also squabbles
without end between the Commons and Bishops,
between Popes and Emperors. Yet Robert
Annys felt that the problem lay far deeper than
either Franciscan or Benedictine or Papal Collector
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>had put it; if the clergy really loved their
brethren, their moneys naturally would slip
through their fingers, none could remain either
for pomp or display, or for Papal claims. If
nobles really loved the poor workers in the fields,
and wept over their poverty, their wealth could
not roll up for the endowment of chantries, the
embroidering of altar cloths, or the embellishment
of the tombs of saints. The whole vexed
question would soon solve itself. Yet Marsiglio,
the Italian seer, and Robert Annys, the English
poor priest who was inspired by his teachings,
both had been banished from the Church!</p>

<p>Besides, the Hierarchy could not forgive the
attempt to teach the common folk to read the
Bible for themselves. For this were Wyclif and
all his followers anathema. A most pious Churchman
thus made to Rome his moan:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"He translates the Scriptures from Latin into English, not
the angelic tongue, whence it becomes by his means common
and more open to laymen and the women who know how to
read, than it is to tolerably learned and very intelligent clergymen,
and the gospel pearl is scattered and trampled upon by
swine."</p></div>

<p>Had this warm defender of the Church Hierarchical
witnessed the reverence and tenderness
with which the heavy folios were handled by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>those same lay men and women, had he witnessed
something of the patient toil whereby they gained
the knowledge of its contents, he scarce would
have found it in his heart to pen that contemptuous
metaphor!</p>

<h2>IX</h2>


<p>The low-roofed tavern at Bury Saint Edmunds
was a favorite place for the men to gather together
at the close of their day's work. It was a place of
good cheer, not alone because there was ale in
plenty&mdash;none of your cheap, thin, penny ale either,
such as is brewed for the day-laborer's dole, but
good strong ale of the best and brownest brew&mdash;nor
alone from the sense of comradeship that
reigned, but also because there was warmth and
comfort within, while without it was dark with
usually a high northeast wind racing about one's
ears, if one but ventured forth. And, moreover,
there was light here, while at home one would
have to go straightway to bed; for artificial light,
even of the home-made candles of rushes dipped
in grease, was entirely too expensive a luxury to be
wasted. Here at the tavern, although the flaring
rushlights, stuck high up over the oak wainscoting,
gave a rather uncertain light; yet it was easy to
distinguish one's neighbors, and it was as good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>as one could expect outside of the church. The
church was the one place where hundreds of candles
at a time, of purest wax, blazed with a superb
indifference to cost. There was also some illumination
from the glowing logs which burned in
the centre of the floor, sending a slender pillar of
smoke up to the hole in the roof which served as
a vent. When the door of the tavern was opened,
the wind drove the smoke about the room into
every crack and cranny, but none coughed or
complained of the smarting of the eyes, for this
was a discomfort to which they were well accustomed.</p>

<p>One night there were seated about the long
oaken table that ran the length of the room, a
goodly number of men. Those at one end of the
table kept their voices low and discussed and
planned matters of grave import, while from
some roisterers at the other end of the table
came frequent bold oaths and hoarse cries of
"Pass the ale" and "Who holds the bowl?"</p>

<p>Among the serious ones was a great, powerfully
built fellow whom they called Ralph Rugge,
and on whom they looked as the leader of the
men of the Bury. And there were Tim the
needle-maker, Thomas Pye the wagon-maker,
Jack the smith, and Robert Annys just arrived.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>There were one or two others, noticeable among
them all a youthful giant called Richard Meryl,
towards whose frank, handsome face the poor
priest's eyes constantly wandered.</p>

<p>After Annys had taken the edge off his hunger,
doing full justice to the food that was placed
before him on a neatly scraped trencher of hard
oak, Rugge turned to him and said, "Hast any
news from John Ball?"</p>

<p>"I bear with me a letter from him," was the reply.</p>

<p>"What, from gaol?"</p>

<p>"Yea, from Maidstone gaol hath he sent it by
trusty messengers."</p>

<p>A look of interest ran from man to man, and
they edged their stools closer about him. Annys
read the letter to them with many misgivings, for
he felt that it but fed their angry passions, and
that it was like a spark to a pile of dried fagots.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Good people," the letter began, "things will never go well
in England so long as goods be not in common, and so long as
there be villeins and gentlemen. By what right are they whom
we call lords greater folk than we? On what grounds have
they deserved it? Why do they hold us in serfage? If we all
came of the same father and mother, of Adam and Eve, how
can they say or prove that they are better than we, if it be not
that they make us gain for them by our toil what they spend in
their pride? They are clothed in velvet and warm in their
furs and their ermines, while we are covered with rags. They
have wine and spices and fair bread; and we have oat-cakes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>and straw and water to drink. They have leisure and fine
houses; we have pain and labor, the rain and the wind in the
fields."</p></div>

<p>"That's God's truth, God's truth!" came from
all sides, enthusiastically.</p>

<p>"May the fires of hell burn me if they'll not be
saying next that they did come from Adam and
Eve, but that we came from some baser stock,"
exclaimed young Meryl with a bitter laugh.</p>

<p>"I tell you," added another, "until we show
our lords that we are worth to them as much as
their cattle, we shall not receive the same care
and fodder."</p>

<p>"Dost hanker after hay?" called out a wit.</p>

<p>"Well," answered the other, abashed at the
laugh that followed, "they are precious anxious
to keep their cattle sleek and fat, and they might
cast a thought on their men to keep their paunches
fairly well lined."</p>

<p>"Ay! the cattle must have the fat of the land,
but the men may go hungry," growled Thomas Pye.</p>

<p>"<em>May</em> go hungry, forsooth! I have not known
a day for many a month that I have had my fill,"
said Tim the needle-maker, wistfully.</p>

<p>"We'll show them, we'll show them," cried an
evil-looking fellow with a leer of hatred. "Their
cattle cannot burn their palaces over their heads."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>
<p>"There'll be no liberty in this land until every
palace lies smoking on the ground," agreed
another.</p>

<p>"They won't be so glad of their fine wines when
they see us pouring them down our throats," exclaimed
one.</p>

<p>"Nor of their jewelled goblets when they see
them at our lips," continued another in the same
strain.</p>

<p>Annys groaned, for he had dreaded just such
an outburst. He was about to command that
this wild talk cease instantly when Rugge, whose
patience had also given way, leaned close to the
last speaker, and rammed a formidable-looking
fist into his face, crying, "Look, Adam Clymme,
the man who speaks like that is a traitor to the
Cause, and a worse traitor than any abbot or
clerk."</p>

<p>The man jerked back his head. "What d'ye
mean?" he asked sullenly.</p>

<p>"Just what I said. Our cause is just, we want
to be free men, we want to live as decent men
should; but that does not mean that we covet the
rich man's jewels and wines. We will be looked
upon as thieves and murderers, not honest men
asking for our rights."</p>

<p>The fellow flushed and muttered angrily, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>several raised their voices and cried, "He's right,
Ralph Rugge's right!" Annys looked gratefully
at Rugge, who continued warmly: "They'll be
glad enough to call us thieves. We'll take
their gold and jewels and fine linens and burn
them in great bonfires all throughout the land to
show we don't approve of such gewgaws. No one
must say we are rising because we are greedy for
these things for ourselves. I warn ye, wherever I
am in command, I shall strike dead the first man
that steals, if it be only so much as a bit of silver."</p>

<p>"Good! Good!" spoke up young Meryl with
ringing voice. "For no cause was ever won by
thieves and robbers; we be honest men who seek
what is ours by right." His face shone with
enthusiasm as he spoke.</p>

<p>"Ay! but it is by the sweat of our brows and
the stoop of our backs that the rich have these
things," protested Jack the smith.</p>

<p>But Annys now spoke.</p>

<p>"My friends," he said, "ye all know of that
great and noble poet Will Langland whose hero
is Piers Ploughman."</p>

<p>"Ay, marry! we all know Will Langland."</p>

<p>"Let me tell you what he saith of envy, and we
shall see that the counsel of Ralph Rugge is wise
and just:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Then, when Repentance bids him be sorry,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Think of that terrible picture, when ye are

dwelling-place in your hearts. Read Holy Writ,
rather, and consider that such as have riches and
joy on this earth have received their reward, but
that ours is for all eternity."</p>

<p>When he had done speaking the young man
on whom the poor priest's eyes had been fixed
in a kind of special appeal leaned across the
table, and holding out a strong sinewy hand,
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am Richard Meryl, and I fear I have been
among the envious ones; but by the Mother of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>Christ thou dost speak well, and I shall do my
best to hearken unto thee.</p>

<p>"And yet," he added, with an engaging smile,
as Annys wrung his hand heartily, "and yet it is
hard to be other than sorry while Covetousness
and Greed rule the land and crush us poor folk
like corn beneath the stone."</p>

<p>"Ay!" returned Annys, "I would have ye none
other than sorry for that&mdash;but sorry to some purpose.
What good will it do to rise up and rule
the land for a day? Shall we not rather by
patience and fortitude hold what we gain for
unborn generations, so that our children's children
need not fight the great fight over again,
but may start where we leave off?"</p>

<p>"That my children's children have full bellies
easeth not the wind in mine," grumbled Jack the
smith.</p>

<p>But Meryl spoke up hotly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"He who works only for to-day will starve to-morrow."</p>

<p>And Annys felt that he had won a helpful
friend.</p>

<p>"When dost think the whole country will be
ready?" asked Rugge of Annys.</p>

<p>"Plenty yet to do, plenty to do," was the reply.
"There are counties where they await but the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>word, but there are others where they are none
too ready to loose hand from the plough."</p>

<p>"Ay, those are the counties where the plough
yet yields a living somewhat better than a dog's."</p>

<p>"Yea, there are places in the land where the
Black Death but took away enough mouths to fill
those that remain. There the men have a cold
heart and an unready ear, and it is hard enough to
beat into them a sense of fellowship for those who
are suffering and a-hungering afar off. It is slow
work getting from east to west and from south
to north, yet the good work prospers surely.
Steadily the people are coming to right knowledge.
More and more Holy Writ is being placed
into their hands, and it taketh but small wit to
see there is something awry with a world which
matcheth so ill with its Word."</p>

<p>"Ay!" cried one lustily, "did the world go by
the Book, there would be no woe and unruth."</p>

<p>"Yes," spoke up Richard Meryl, "but the world
goes not by the law of Holy Writ, but by the law
of Westminster, and therein lieth all the unrest.
Did they not seek to put man's law above God's
law, there would be no rebellion."</p>

<p>Annys nodded approvingly. There was something
rarely winning in this young man.</p>

<p>"Hast heard of the new law which the Commons
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>have passed?" asked Thomas Pye the
wagon-maker of young Meryl.</p>

<p>"Let them pass their laws at Westminster,"
exclaimed one man, passionately, "and let's see
how well they can cultivate their lands with
parchment rolls."</p>

<p>"What have they done now?" asked Meryl.</p>

<p>"They have declared that 'carters, ploughmen,
plough drivers, shepherds, swineherds, deyes, and
other servants should be content with such liveries
and wages as they received in the twentieth
year of King Edward's reign.'"</p>

<p>"'Declared that we be content,'" mocked Tim
the needle-maker. "Have they so, indeed!" Then
rising, he addressed the others in a loud voice.
"Fellows, the law hath declared that we be content.
Why then so we must be&mdash;by Westminster
law which can call the sky green if it take a
notion&mdash;it must be so."</p>

<p>"Content then," broke in Ralph Rugge, with a
laugh, "is but a matter of a drop of ink on the
end of a quill."</p>

<p>"Next they will fill our empty stomachs with
parchment sheets," uttered one fellow, in strong
disgust, whereat a great laugh went up because
the speaker, Richard Bole, was known for a great
glutton.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>
<p>"But that is not all," said the first speaker.
"They will not that one should depart from one
part of the country to another to serve, or reside
elsewhere, or under pretence of going to a pilgrimage,
without a letter patent, specifying cause
of his departure and time of his return, granted
at discretion of the justice of the peace."</p>

<p>"Yea," continued Ralph Rugge, taking the
words out of the other's mouth, "and if such a
runaway be caught, he will be imprisoned for fifteen
days and branded on the forehead with the
letter F; and any one found harboring him would
be liable to a fine of ten pounds."</p>

<p>"Curse their insolence!" muttered one whose
face was flushed with liquor and whose hands
trembled with something other than indignation.
"Curse their insolence! Next they will seek to
plant us in the soil with a spade chained to our
arms!"</p>

<p>"Yea, it is hard," spoke up Annys, with a sigh;
"it is a bondage worse than that of the Hebrews
in Egypt; yet remain steadfast and patient, and
all must come right in the end."</p>

<p>At the other end of the table the men grew more
and more under the influence of the flowing ale.</p>

<p>A strong voice now rang out from the lower
end of the table:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">

      <div class="verse">"'Since they fetched my fair cattle in the fold:</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>By the time the last line was reached the whole
room took it up, and the walls shook with the
song:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    </div>
  </div>
</div>


<p>At the close of the song, Rugge looked about
him, and singled out from a dark corner, where he
had been quietly looking on, a shy lad in the garb
of a minstrel, who, hugging his rebec under his
arm, shambled awkwardly up to his leader.</p>

<p>"Hither, my brave boy," cried Rugge, presenting
him to Annys; "this is Jack Nicol, a better
friend to the Cause than those who swing a broad
axe or train an arrow against those who live only
by labor of tongue. This youth never opens his
lips but he risks a broken pate, and indeed he is
very like to find himself clapped into gaol for his
bold songs which do stir the people up to ask
for their freedom."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>
<p>"Good!" cried Annys, clapping the boy upon
his back; "we shall know each other better before
long, for I shall have need of thee."</p>

<p>"I am ready," replied the boy, yet rubbing his
head somewhat ruefully on the spot where the
sheriff's stick had been all too familiar with it.</p>

<p>"Yea, these minstrels do wot well how to reach
the heart of the people," said Rugge, "and a good
stirring rime can do more in a moment than much
preaching can do in many months."</p>

<p>"A rime, a rime, give us one now," they called
to the minstrel.</p>

<p>"Yea, a rime, a rime, a geste!" ran through
the room.</p>

<p>The boy hung back for an instant, and then,
putting his rebec tenderly to his chin, launched
forth upon the song that of all others stirred the
blood the quickest, the song so dear to the people
that scarce any gathering would disperse until
the rafters rang with its well-conned words:&mdash;</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The roisterers looked up and left their hands
from the tankards, the nodding heads first stiffened
and then kept time to the rhythm, the sodden
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>faces brightened, while the young minstrel, in a
peculiarly sweet voice, sang on of Robyn's men

<p>"Help, help, save me, hide me for the love of
Christ!" All looked up startled as this cry came
from outside, and at the same time the door was
flung open and there was blown into the room,
with the gusty wind, a man who, after casting a
swift, appealing glance at the faces about the table,
sank exhausted to the floor. Even without the
sudden cry for help, the wild appearance of the
fellow would have been sufficient to startle them.
He was dressed as a pilgrim, and the long gown
was rent here and there, as if torn in some struggle.
The pilgrim's staff, although still tightly
grasped by one hand, was broken off short, the
vernicle had been wrenched from his cap by violent
hands, and now hung by a thread, swaying
and bobbing with every move of his head. The
fellow's cheeks were hollow, his sunken temples
throbbed tumultuously, his lips were dry and pallid,
his eyes were wild, his hair and beard matted
and unkempt.</p>

<p>Here was before them one of the very pretended
pilgrims of whom they had spoken.
Doubtless the sheriffs had seen through his disguise,
and were even then hot upon his heels.</p>

<p>The fellow had sunk at the feet of Tim the
needle-maker. He opened his eyes feebly, and
murmured one more "Help me!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>
<p>"Ten pounds fine for the harboring of such,"
muttered Tim, as he took to his heels and closed
the door behind him.</p>

<p>Others became alarmed.</p>

<p>"Ten pounds! 'tis more than I possess in the
whole world!"</p>

<p>"Ten pounds! Mother Mary!"</p>

<p>Annys rose indignantly. "Cowards!" he hissed.
"Is this your boasted fellowship? Is this the way
ye succor your brother?"</p>

<p>But, before he had done, Richard Meryl had
quickly risen, lifted the fallen man, and guided
him through the door. He knew a hiding-place
where all such refugees were welcomed for the
sake of one who had died in the same desperate
attempt to win a decent living.</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>



<h2>X</h2>


<p>The following morning Annys sought out
Richard Meryl to learn more of the refugee. As
he was conducted to the hiding-place, young
Meryl related something of the women who were
risking so much for a stranger.</p>

<p>"I am bringing you to old Dame Westel and
her granddaughter Matilda," he said. "When
Matilda was but a babe in arms, her father,
tempted by the bait of large wages in Suffolk,
was returned by the sheriffs, branded. But his
wife being big with child, and he watching her
cheeks grow hollow day by day, he grew desperate
and made a second attempt. For this he was
thrown into gaol and suffered to lie there and rot.
He died of gangrene of both feet while his wife
slowly starved to death, and her babe within her."</p>

<p>"Horrible, horrible!" exclaimed Annys; "there
is more justice done to kine than to man made in
the image of God. O my God! how long can
this be endured?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>
<p>"Ay! thy cry of patience burns on thy tongue,
doth it not?"</p>

<p>"Ay, so. But tell me some more."</p>

<p>"You will see for yourself. The poor old
woman lives only for two things&mdash;to hide others
who should pass through, and to pore over a torn
and dog-eared copy of the Bible which a poor
priest did leave with her."</p>

<p>Annys was much interested. "Ah, she will get
much comfort and peace from the Holy Book."</p>

<p>The young man laughed. "As to that, I wot
not; rather she does suck the vengeance and
wrath from its pages e'en as a babe sucks its
mother's milk."</p>

<p>"Say you so? 'Tis ill, indeed. I shall change
all that, and bring speedy comfort to her."</p>

<p>"Well, thou hast a bold heart, then. I wish
thee joy of thy task."</p>

<p>"Lives she all by herself?"</p>

<p>Richard colored. "Nay, her granddaughter,
Matilda, is an angel if ever one walked this earth.
She does devote herself to the old woman, and
yet never is word of complaint suffered to pass
her lips."</p>

<p>"And that is all?"</p>

<p>"Oh," he replied, with a shrug of his shoulders,
"no one counts the other granddaughter, a sullen,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>proud beauty, the illegitimate daughter of the old
Baron de Leaufort, uncle of the present one, and
long since gone to Hell if ever sinner went
there."</p>

<p>"Poor woman! she seems to have had trouble
enough."</p>

<p>"Trouble! Ay! And yet, alas, the tale is
not a rare one. It is hard to have faith in the
goodness of God when one sounds all the misery
on earth."</p>

<p>"The works of God are hidden among men,"
replied Annys, gravely, as they came to one of
the humblest of the wattled huts that made up
the village, and paused before it.</p>

<p>"'They shall inherit the Kingdom of Heaven.'
The poor shall inherit the Kingdom of Heaven.
Ha! ha!"</p>

<p>The voice came from within.</p>

<p>Outside on a low stool, engaged in her spinning,
sat a lovely young girl, in whose sweet, open
countenance, touched with a gentle gravity beyond
her years, the poor priest recognized
Matilda Westel.</p>

<p>He inquired after the refugee and was told that
he was resting, and that at daybreak he was to be
taken to the highway and instructed how to make
the next town before nightfall. His garb had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>been neatly repaired, and a new staff found for
him. Annys offered to give him a rosary.</p>

<p>"Would thy grandmother care to see me?"
he asked.</p>

<p>A quick look passed from the girl to Richard,
who stood by her side.</p>

<p>"Tell him," she begged the young man, who
seemed to hesitate how to begin.</p>

<p>"In what way can I serve thee?" Annys
asked.</p>

<p>"Matilda's grandmother," began Richard, "can
read only very little. She has picked up enough
to read only a few texts which that poor priest
of whom I spake to you taught her by heart. It
has ever been her desire to read further in the
Book."</p>

<p>"And if it be not too much trouble," continued
the girl, "I had hoped perhaps that I might
be taught also to read, that my eyes might save
grandmother's old and tired ones."</p>

<p>"Yea, that she might be her eyes, as she has
been for years her head and feet and hands,"
exclaimed Richard, heartily, and Annys caught
the look of love that illumined his face as his
eyes rested on her. It heartened the poor priest
to be in the presence of an affection which was so
far removed from the morbid hysterical emotion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>of the monks and saints, whose confessions had
always disgusted rather than edified him.</p>

<p>"Shall we go in?" ventured Annys, and, receiving
the young girl's permission, he entered
the low door and discovered a wrinkled old dame
seated on a low stool poring over a copy of
Wyclif's Vulgate, crooning over to herself certain
lines which she had evidently learned by heart.</p>

<p>"'They shall inherit the Kingdom of Heaven.'
The poor of this earth shall inherit the Kingdom
of Heaven. Is it not so, Sir Poor Priest?"</p>

<p>On his entrance, she had risen, and almost
shrieked this in her thin, cracked treble.</p>

<p>"Yea, surely, surely," answered the poor priest
soothingly, "the good Book hath it so."</p>

<p>She looked up into his face eagerly, and searched
it with her dim eyes.</p>

<p>"Robert Annys, they tell me that you do learn
poor folk to read&mdash;see, I wot well what is here,
'Give none occasion to a man to curse thee, for
if he curse thee, in the bitterness of his soul, he
that made him will hear his supplication.'</p>

<p>"And here," she continued, seating herself and
bending low over the book as she rapidly turned
the pages with her trembling fingers, "here
Solomon saith, 'that no king had other beginning,
but all men have one entrance into life and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>a like departure.' Oh, that I wot right well, but
there is more, there is more, that I would read
for myself; there is a part which ever I seek which
tells that it is easier for a camel to pass through
the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter
the kingdom of heaven. Show me that, and
if canst help me read the wonderful Book, then
shall a poor woman's blessing follow thee all the
days of thy life."</p>

<p>Annys regarded her pityingly. "Right gladly
will I help thee. And I shall tell thee of other
parts of Holy Writ that speak of Love and Forgiveness,
and teach thee that part which saith,
'Love your enemies and forgive those that trespass
against you.'"</p>

<p>But the old woman flung the book straightway
at his head in a passion, crying, "I will none of
thy book; and it says that, I want none of it. Not
for that would I toil and wear out mine eyes
reading it. Nay, nay, thou art wrong. Thou
dost seek to pull the wool over mine eyes. For
doth not the good Book say:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"'Woe unto you that are rich. Woe unto you, ye that are
full now, for ye shall hunger. Woe unto you, ye that laugh now,
for ye shall mourn and weep'?"</p></div>

<p>And, quite exhausted by her tirade, she sank
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>back again on her stool. Annys bent over her,
greatly shocked, and took one of her hands in
his and stroked it tenderly.</p>

<p>"Yet, my good woman," he said, in low, gentle
tones, "yet is there not more comfort in love
and forgiveness, than in revengeful wrath and
hate?"</p>

<p>The old woman snatched away her hand and
swayed to and fro, beating the floor with one
foot and moaning softly.</p>

<p>"Oh, these priests, these priests," at last she
broke out fiercely, "they wot not a tenth part of
our woes, or they could not find it in their hearts
to prate ever of love and forgiveness."</p>

<p>"I but seek to bring peace to thy heart," remonstrated
Annys, "for peace can never enter save
through love. Besides, how canst thou say the
Lord's prayer? Doth it not say: 'Forgive us
our sins, as we forgive them that have misdone
against us'?"</p>

<p>"Nay!" returned the old woman, stubbornly,
"I do pray to that God who said, 'An eye for an
eye, a tooth for a tooth.'"</p>

<p>He was about to touch on his favorite theme,
the new spirit of Charity and Love that the
Christ had brought into the sterner religion of
the Old Testament, but now she burst forth even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>more vehemently, rising and tossing her arms high
over her head.</p>

<p>"What is thy boasted religion that would take
from an old woman her sole comfort?</p>

<p>"'Love mine enemies,' indeed! Does good
God expect me to love that Baron de Leaufort&mdash;now
suffering the torments of hell-fire, if ever sinner
doth&mdash;who made merry within his castle,
while my daughter, my beautiful, merry Rose, lay
forgotten on the moat, brought there through
him? And am I to love those lawmakers at
Westminster who say that no man may move
hand or foot to seek an honest living, but must
stay rooted in the earth where he happened to
grow, like a rotting trunk? Oh, yes, one may
wander from Lincoln to London if it be but for
merrymaking and foolishness; but no man may
travel to the next county if it be to place bread
between the teeth of his children. Bah! a fig
care I for thy kind of religion! Begone, begone,
with thy smooth tongue and thy sleek face,
begone!"</p>

<p>But Annys did not go. Sighing heavily, he
said: "My poor woman, take such comfort as is
left to thee. I shall come again to-morrow and I
shall teach thee such texts as thou wilt have.
Indeed, I shall teach also thy granddaughter that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>she may aid thee. Be comforted, I pray thee,"
and, with a warm pressure of the hand, he was
gone.</p>

<p>His heart was heavy that night. Was this,
then, to be the end of placing the Bible in the
hands of the people? Was their God to be a
God of Vengeance and Wrath instead of Charity
and Love? Instead of coming nearer Christ
Jesus, were they to be further from Him than
ever?</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>



<h2>XI</h2>


<p>During the next few months, Annys made his
way to the Bury whenever he could. No sacrifice
was too great if it could give him a few hours
with his new-found friends, Richard and Matilda.
To him there was quite a new sense of belonging
to some one place, of having a home where his
friends awaited him. He had led a lonely life.
At Oxford he had been a close student and had
never joined in the riotous gatherings and bouts
of the students; his master he had adored, but no
man had he called friend. Later, during his
wandering life as poor priest, many a heartfelt
blessing had been poured upon him and many a
sombre face brightened at the sight of him, but
he had had no real comrade.</p>

<p>Richard Meryl had been as strongly drawn to
Annys as the poor priest to him, and, under his
influence, gradually the Uprising appealed to
Meryl as far more than a longing for a full stomach.
Before Annys had come, he had been one
of the unruly ones, anxious to storm castles and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>manors if need be to better their horrible condition.
But now he worked ardently with the poor
priest to instil into the people a noble patience,
an idealism that would enable them to hold forever
whatever success they would gain.</p>

<p>The men did not take Meryl's change of heart
very kindly. He, one of the most eager, now to
be holding them back!</p>

<p>"Every yonker hath become a seer," sneered
one of the older men, as Meryl was admonishing
them in the poor priest's absence.</p>

<p>The blood rose swiftly to the young man's
cheeks.</p>

<p>"One is never too young to learn. It seems
that one may be too old," he said angrily.</p>

<p>"Bah! a fig for thy dreaming poor priest. Give
us a torch, say I, and march upon all the castles
and abbeys in the land&mdash;the sooner the better.
The more we delay the more the Barons will laugh
and call us but idle boasters."</p>

<p>"Ay," retorted Meryl, "go thou and a handful
of others. For a while ye will think yourselves
the masters of the earth. Yet it will be as a drop
in the bucket compared to what shall be gained
if ye bide in patience till the men of every county
be ready to rise. Then all the nobles of the land
cannot withstand us."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>
<p>"There is something in his counsellings, after
all," murmured the old man. "Yet it is bitter
biding the time, and patience and an eager belly
go ill together."</p>

<p>Meanwhile Robert Annys led a busy life, making
frequent trips to the neighboring towns and
hamlets, and preaching before great gatherings.
The excommunication bore little fruit. Even
Annys was astonished to find how few men
cared. For there were many reasons why men
still continued to hold fellowship with him. First,
they needed him, they found that he brought
them what they craved. Also, at no time had
the Papacy been held in such scant reverence.
How could the spectacle of two rival, quarrelling
Popes struggling and wrangling over the chair of
Peter as two dogs snarling over a bone, fail to
hold up the sacred office to ridicule? Moreover,
little by little the figure of the Pope, albeit that
he wore upon his head a mitre whose three
jewelled crowns cost over five hundred thousand
pieces of gold, was waning in majesty and power
before that simple figure of a man upon whose
forehead rested only a crown of thorns. At a
different period, earlier or later, Annys would
have found himself in terrible isolation; men
would have shrunk from the slightest contact
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>with him, and he would have suffered keenly,
even for the ordinary necessities of life. But now
so little heed was paid to his excommunication,
that a second Papal Bull was launched forth,
anathematizing even such as should listen to the
heretical and incendiary preaching of this poor
priest, Robert Annys.</p>

<p>And still the rustics continued to gather about
him whenever he appeared, in the fields, or at
the cross-roads, or at the very thresholds of the
Church that banished him. Men sent for him to
speak with them when they were disheartened;
they sent for him when they wished for tidings
of the Great Uprising; they sent for him to shrive
their souls when they faced the awful journey
through eternity, forgetting that it was denied
him to perform the offices of Holy Church, remembering
only the strong grip of his hand and
the love-light in his eyes that somehow seemed
to make the great journey less terrible. Dimly
struggling through the hierarchical, conventional
conception of the priestly office, was coming
the recognition of the priest as just a human
brother with the sorrows and temptations of all
men, and just a little more spirituality and helpfulness
than is given to all.</p>

<p>Once, when Annys returned from a long journey,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>he was more exhausted than usual. Matilda
was frankly frightened. Indeed, Richard had
of late questioned in his heart if her interest in
the poor priest were not growing more intense
than mere friendship would warrant. He had
watched them together over their Bible with a
terrible foreboding in his heart. He had noted,
also, the swift illumination of her face whenever
Annys returned to them. He was not really
betrothed to Matilda, and yet since he had first
known her as a little girl he had never thought
of marrying another woman. Their friendship
had been constant and devoted, but as yet no
words of love had been spoken on either side.</p>

<p>"Thou dost look worn and weary," exclaimed
Matilda, tenderly, as she laid out for Annys such
simple refreshment as she could offer. "It is
more than human strength can bear, such work
as thine. Take a rest now with us," she added
solicitously.</p>

<p>Annys looked into her kind eyes and smiled.
He passed one thin hand wearily over his brow.
Ah, if it were only the body that was weary.
He raised some food mechanically to his lips.</p>

<p>Matilda wondered if he was conscious of the
fact that he was eating. There was a hunted
look in his eyes as he exclaimed suddenly:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>
<p>"God wot, what strange hocus-pocus planted me
in Ball's shoes. The devil himself could not have
made a stranger misfit."</p>

<p>"How canst say so?" exclaimed Meryl, indignantly.
"Have I not heard it said that not even
John Ball himself can sway men to his will as
Robert Annys can? Do not men wait for thy
coming from Norfolk to Sussex?"</p>

<p>"Ay! well enough can I sway them to my will
when it does not go contrary to theirs," he murmured.
And then he smiled to think that he
should be trying to explain to these simple
friends all the intricate workings of his heart.
And yet there was something soothing in their
ready sympathy, there was something calming in
voicing his innermost dread, so that he continued
more in soliloquy than conversation.</p>

<p>"Ah! it is not that I do not have great power
over the men; rather is it that I have so much
power, and fear to use it ill. 'Twould be easier
far to fail than to succeed with a question ever
eating into one's vitals. It is a curse for a leader
of men to be possessed of imagination. It is to
see the furthermost end to which our own words
and deeds take us. No sage could endure to see
the effect of his own teachings. Either his heart
would break or his reason be unseated. What
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>would have been the agony of St. Francis could
he have looked into the future and seen the
powerful Franciscan monasteries actually condemned
for their great properties. Could Christ
have seen the Church of His disciples straying farther
from His teachings than ever had the Church
of the Jews, then well might He have cried,&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Eli, Eli, lama Sabachthani?' 'My God, my
God, why hast thou forsaken me?'"</p>

<p>Matilda had sunk to the floor during this impassioned
speech, and looked up into the poor
priest's noble, sensitive face with a rapt gaze in
which Meryl read the confirmation of his suspicions.
His own face grew sombre and gloomy
as Annys continued.</p>

<p>"Ah, such agonies, my friends, have I endured,
passing among men and trying to plant the seed
of good-fellowship among them, and seeing but
the weeds of envy and hatred spring up in their
stead; trying to awaken in their hearts pity for
the sufferings of their brethren, and stirring up
only vengeance against the rich. What have I
not suffered in trying to arouse self-sacrifice and
self-control and a steadfastness to noble ideals,
and finding only bitterness of spirit and rapaciousness
and self-seeking!"</p>

<p>He pushed his low stool away from the table,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>and paced about the room rapidly, sometimes his
hands striking one another in fierce energy, and
again at times stretched out appealingly to
heaven, while his auditors sat in silence, full of
their own thoughts. "Oh, how I have poured
forth love and sympathy upon you, my brethren!
How have I dreamed, awake and asleep, of the
Great Uprising! How have I pictured the
orderly, majestic march of hundreds of thousands
of men, the wonderful gathering together of men
from all parts of the realm, the coming before the
King with their just grievances, ever orderly and
self-respecting, and upheld by the consciousness
of right-doing. And then how I have wept tears
of joy to think that the King could not but give
heed, and that he would make of them all free
men, free, no longer serfs and villeins, but free
as good God created them.</p>

<p>"And what do I see?" he cried wildly, as he
cast himself down on a settle and bowed his face
in his hands. "What do I see? I see England
swept from north to south, from Lincoln to
Kent, by the flames of infuriated incendiaries.
I see castles sacked, abbeys ruined. I see the
people, my people, God's people, drunk with
power, blind with rage, going madly into the
trap the nobles have set for them. My eyes are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>blinded night and day by the glare of the conflagration,
my ears are deafened by the shrieks
of the victims, there is blood upon everything.
There is blood upon this settle, there is blood
upon this table, there is blood upon this goblet.
Sometimes I fear that I shall go mad. I see
decapitated heads on the gates of the town, they
glare at me and make grimaces at me, and cry
out, 'This is thy work, thine, O minister of Hell!'
Fatherless babes and widowed mothers curse me
and cry out against me. O my God, they say
'This is all thy work&mdash;thine!'" For an instant
he sat brooding over his thoughts in silence.</p>

<p>Then with a sudden, swift transformation which
was characteristic of the man, his mood changed,
and, springing up, he threw one arm affectionately
about Meryl and smiled brightly.</p>

<p>"Yet with such friends about me, how can I
fail?"</p>

<p>To his surprise, Meryl flung away his arm with
a passionate movement and started back.</p>

<p>The poor priest's sensitive face quivered.</p>

<p>"What have I done? Richard, what is it?"
he cried.</p>

<p>"Nay, nay, 'tis nothing, believe me," Meryl exclaimed,
abashed instantly at his action. "I was
but startled and wist not what I did. Forgive me!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>
<p>But, when Annys was gone, Matilda had not
forgiven him.</p>

<p>"To act so rudely to our Robert Annys!" she
cried reproachfully.</p>

<p>The young man did not reply at once, but
stood with dogged sullenness regarding her
fixedly.</p>

<p>"Why, what has come over thee, Richard? I
do not know thee."</p>

<p>"You love him," he blurted out, awkwardly.</p>

<p>The blood rushed to the girl's face, even reddening
her ears. For an instant she looked at
him speechless, her breast heaving tumultuously
and great tear-drops running down her cheeks.
He was frightened at the effect of his brutal
words.</p>

<p>"Forgive me," he stammered. "I meant not
to hurt thee, but, Matilda, dear heart, there has
never been other maid in the world for me."</p>

<p>"Oh, Richard, Richard," she sobbed, "he is a
priest, a priest of God, and thou canst speak to
me like this!"</p>

<p>"So, then, you wot not that the poor priests
do marry."</p>

<p>At this she started violently, and all the color
sped quickly from her cheeks.</p>

<p>"How&mdash;a priest wed!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>
<p>"Ay!" he said bitterly, seeing how it was with
her. "Ay, John Ball hath preached for many a
day that all priests should be as other men, even
to the taking of a wife."</p>

<p>"Oh, Richard, I wist not, I wist not. I thought
a priest was above other men&mdash;I never thought
of him as&mdash;as&mdash;" and she turned from him and
flung her face in her arms on the table. And
there he left her, for he had not that within him
to comfort her, seeing that his own heart was

<h2>XII</h2>


<p>With his friends, Richard and Matilda, Annys
continued the same frank intercourse, entirely
ignorant of what had taken place between them.</p>

<p>Yet there were others besides Richard Meryl
who had eyes to read Matilda's secret. Some there
were that thought it a pity to see the unselfish
devotion of a lifetime go so ill rewarded. For it
was a question how the Westels could have lived
had it not been that young Meryl had worked
their tiny tenure of land, and rendered service in
their stead, giving his lord two days' ploughing for
himself and two for them, and in the same way
doubling his days of sowing and reaping, digging
and carting, that the women might keep their
modest holding. In this Matilda had given him
such help as had been in her power; nevertheless
to her and hers he had been father, son, brother,
lover, and day laborer, all in one. Others there
were that, holding Matilda to be the ideal poor
priest's wife, saw in it the hand of God.</p>

<p>Among those that read Matilda's heart was
her cousin, Rose Westel, she whose mother had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>thrown herself in her despair into the moat of Ely
Castle. She had never encountered the poor
priest. She was not fond of long, sanctimonious
faces. It was just like Matilda, she thought, to fall
in love with a russet cloth saint.</p>

<p>As Rose was about to start off one afternoon to
her favorite haunt in the woods, where she could
indulge in her day-dreams and for a brief space at
least forget a reality that she hated, her grandmother
stopped her.</p>

<p>"Why dost not stay at home and read the
Scriptures with us?" she asked.</p>

<p>The girl turned and laughed merrily. "Oh,
grandmother, for shame! Hast not said again
and again that I am selfish and tread ever upon
the feelings of others? And wouldst now have
me interfere with Matilda and her devoted priest?
Nay, then, 'twould be too cruel to come between
them when they make such beautiful love over
their 'Thus saith the Lords,' and their 'Holy,
Holy, Holies.'"</p>

<p>Matilda sprang up with cheeks all aflame and
fled into the house, vowing that she would never
forgive her, never, never. But the old dame only
chuckled slyly, in a manner that took away all
the sting from the harsh words that she flung
after Rose.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>
<p>"Get thee gone, thou hussy! Get thee gone!
Thou art fit only for saucy flings and idle noonings.
Get thee gone before thy cousin's head is
filled with the nonsense that is in thine empty
pate!"</p>

<p>And when the girl had gone, she kept mumbling
to herself with twinkling eyes, "<em>The hussy!</em>
To take a priest and maid at Holy Scriptures and
call it love-making!"</p>

<p>During the lesson that followed, Matilda for the
first time was a dull pupil. Her grandmother,
for a wonder, did not chide her for being so
careless. Her sharp eyes had read the cause of
the girl's confusion.</p>

<p>"Art tired, dear Matilda?" asked Annys kindly,
seeing her hesitate over a simple word. "Thou
art not thy usual quick self to-day."</p>

<p>For answer the girl burst into tears and sped
quickly away.</p>

<p>"Heed not the lass," began the old woman,
"she is not herself to-day. It seems that she and
Richard have had a falling out, for after all these
years that he has wooed her, she will have none
of him. Yet he is a likely-looking chap, too,
and I have scraped and pinched and at last laid
by enough to pay the fine."</p>

<p>"What! Matilda not wed Richard!" exclaimed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>Annys, astounded. "It's impossible! Sure, 'tis
but some lover's quarrel that soon will be made
up. Or else," he suggested, "belike she cares not
to leave her grandmother."</p>

<p>Now who can tell what arouses the humors of
old folk? Surely a smooth enough word, and
kindly enough meant, yet the old woman sprang
up with a red spot on either cheek, and cried
harshly, "Hoity-toity, hoity-toity, Sir Poor Priest,
indeed, indeed! And what should such a fine
wench do but marry, quotha! Nay, nay, let
not such foolish maggots get into the child's
head."</p>

<p>Annys could not bring himself to believe that
Matilda had refused to wed Richard Meryl. The
two friends were as good as married in his eyes,
for he could not think of one without the other.
Surely some foolish lovers' quarrel must be at the
bottom of it. So he took leave of the old woman
and sought out Richard, bent upon being a peacemaker,
and bringing the two together again.</p>

<p>He found his friend in the fields, up to his
knees in a trench which he was digging. Richard
laughed.</p>

<p>"How came you to think we were lovers?" he
asked. He spoke carelessly, but the veins over
his forehead stood out like whip-cords and his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>great fists circled the spade handle so that the
knuckles shone like polished wood.</p>

<p>"Dost mean to tell me thou hast no idea of
wedding Matilda Westel?" asked Annys, in
astonishment.</p>

<p>Richard shrugged his huge shoulders. "Nay,
there is a clear field for thee, hast thou the mind
to."</p>

<p>"Why, man, no sweeter woman draws breath."</p>

<p>The other drew a long breath between his
clenched teeth.</p>

<p>"So says every swain of his sweetheart."</p>

<p>The words were indifferent, but the thick handle
of the spade snapped in two.</p>

<p>Annys looked at it in surprise.</p>

<p>"'Twas cracked yestere'en," stammered Meryl,
hastily looking down on it in some confusion.</p>

<p>For an instant the two men looked steadily
into each other's eyes.</p>

<p>"I wot not how it is with thee," at last began
Annys, gravely. "I had given my life that thou
didst love the maid. I never looked on her sweet,
gentle face that I did not see it in fancy bending
over thy child's cradle. She was so wholly thine
to me, that until this very day I wist not how
dear she was to me."</p>

<p>His friend grasped his hand. "Ay, Robert
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>Annys, I cannot deceive thee. I had thought
rather to see any other man dead than that he
should possess her. Yet she loves thee, and the
power to make her happy hath passed from me to
thee. Only," he added, with a touch of sternness
in his face, "only see that thou dost make her
happy."</p>

<p>"Happy!" he said, "she will be happy if indeed
it is as thou sayst and I can make her so. But I
am bewildered. I cannot understand it that she
should love me, and with thee before her. Thou
art better favored than I, thou art younger and
stronger. It cannot be; nay, there is some mistake."</p>

<p>"I tell thee there is no mistake. She loves
thee."</p>

<p>"Did she tell you so?"</p>

<p>"Yea, that she did."</p>

<p>Then a hundred little scenes rushed back to
him, her eyes fastened on his face, her interest in
his work, her eager greeting on his return, all
lived again for him for a brief moment. And
now he knew.</p>

<p>"I am still dazed," he said. "I can scarce credit
it, but I think it is true."</p>

<p>Then the thought of his friend's grief came to
him.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>
<p>"Ah, would that this had not come to thee,
Richard, my lad. Would I could undo what I
have wrought, even that I had never seen thee
both."</p>

<p>"Nay, nay, say not that!" broke out Meryl,
with strong pain in his voice. "Nay, it is worth
all to have called thee friend. Sure there is a tie
between man and man that may be stronger than
that between man and maid."</p>

<p>"Ah well," sighed Annys, laying one hand tenderly
on the young man's shoulder, "mayhap 'tis
the Cross thou must bear for Christ's sake. For
surely with such a woman by my side, it will be
given me to prove that a wedded priest need not
be taken up with worldly matters and thoughts
of the flesh. Indeed, I shall be perfected in the
work of the Lord. With her help I shall be a
more useful servant to my people, a kindlier comforter
and a wiser adviser. Indeed, I promise
thee that she will be to me as a direct gift from
God."</p>

<h2>XIII</h2>


<p>Just at this time Rose Westel met with an
adventure. She was paying a long-promised
visit to some distant relatives at Ely. It was a
great event in her life, for it was the first time she
had left her home. Any change from the dull
routine at the Bury was welcome, and yet, after
the first excitement died down, she found herself
unhappier than ever. The sight of Ely Castle
proudly rearing its towers over the lowlands awakened
in her a bitter discontent. The great grim
pile stirred curious passions within her breast;
there were times when she looked on it with an
icy dread at her heart, for behind those curving
walls rippled the waters of the moat&mdash;her mother's
deathbed; there were moments when she looked
on it with a secret pride that she should be
descended from one of its haughty rulers. Then
she would give way to frantic rage that she should
not be there presiding as its mistress. It was
common talk that the present Baron was only the
illegitimate son of her father's brother. Why,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>then, had he been chosen instead of her, who
stood nearer in the succession?</p>

<p>No one suspected her of these outbursts, for she
indulged in them only where she was unobserved.
This habit had grown on her since she was a little
tot, and her pride had kept her from showing how
keenly she felt the shrugs and significant glances
of the former companions of her mother. Their
prophecies concerning her future were obvious,
her own idleness and wilfulness being thrown into
high relief by the contrasting industry and self-sacrifice
of her cousin Matilda. There had been
times when she had tried her best to hate Matilda,
who was always being held up to her as a model,
but Matilda's own love and admiration for her
made it impossible.</p>

<p>So for many years she had alternated between
tempestuous fits of determination to fulfil the
kind prophecies of her mother's generation&mdash;to
be out and out wicked and have done with it&mdash;and
sullen resolutions to take the veil and enter
the neighboring convent. The grewsome picture
of her mother's waterlogged body floating on the
moat had kept her from the one, a certain leer
on the Father Confessor's face had kept her from
the other. She never explained to any one why
she had left off going to confession, for what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>would have been the use? They would have
said that she had inherited her mother's wickedness,
so that even saints were tempted by her.
She would never be judged as other maids.</p>

<p>Again and again she asked herself why had
her mother sinned? It was her refusal to wed
either of the two fellows whom her overlord had
chosen for her that brought her to the Baron's
notice. On seeing her he ceased to insist upon
that special prerogative. What right had her
mother to shrink from the churls that had been
allotted to her? Her sin was so unnecessary
that Rose looked on it with bitter impatience.
The thick-flowing blood of the rustics had been
in her veins; she should have been well content
to wed some great bullock of a fellow and
bear him countless stolid, flaxen-haired children.
What right had she to bring into the world a
being with every taste different from those about
her, with every nerve tingling with revolt? True,
Rose herself felt that she would knife a man
before she would mate with one of those great
hulks of men who were little above the oxen they
drove or the sheep they tended. But she had
the right to shudder; gentle blood flowed in her
veins just as truly as it did in the proud Baron
yonder. Just as much as he, she had a right to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>feel her heart leap within her at the sight of luxury
and daintiness and beauty. How her hands
longed to feel the touch of soft furs and velvets
and rich stuffs! Oh, again and again she wished
that her mother had flung her babe also on the
moat.</p>

<p>As she was sitting alone one day underneath
the trees, near the highway, she was startled by
the approach of a gay cavalcade bringing color
and life and laughter into the gloomy woods.
First rode the Baron, usually a superb figure on
his magnificent coal-black horse, but now a most
ridiculous figure with his clothes put on wrong
side forward, his hat tilted over his nose, and long
streamers of different colored ribands hanging
from his beard, down his breast, and along his
legs, where also hung numerous tiny bells tinkling
with every motion. His horse was decorated
as fantastically as its master, and behind him
followed two score of lusty fellows decked out in
motley liveries of green and yellow and covered
with scarves and ribands and laces hung all over
with gold. From each of these jangled and
dangled countless silvern bells, heightening the
din made by the pipers and drummers that followed,
playing weird discords like a devil's dance.
A number of ladies with their gallants, all masked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>and gayly costumed, now rode up, all shrieking
with laughter.</p>

<p>As the Baron caught sight of Rose standing
near the road, gazing at the unwonted sight in
open bewilderment, there swept into his eyes that
look with which all men greeted her beauty. He
whispered a command to one of his lackeys, who
instantly seized the girl and conducted her to the
Baron, who gazed down on her amazed&mdash;for how
could it be that he had overlooked such a rare
beauty in his vicinity? For the moment he regretted
the escapade that made him cut so ridiculous
a figure in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Thou must proclaim thyself a follower of my
Lord of Misrule," he said, smiling down at her
and lifting up her chin with one gauntleted hand.
She did not reply, but gazed on the ground in
embarrassment, the color going and coming in
her cheeks.</p>

<p>"Look, girl," spoke up one of the Baron's companions,
"none may encounter us save they wear
my Lord's badge," and with a leer, he attempted
to fasten a knot of ribands on the girl's kerchief.
She made a quick gesture of impatience and
stepped back angrily, but at a low word from the
Baron she paused, and turned her exquisite profile
toward him.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>
<p>"Wilt refuse my badge?" he asked softly. She
turned her face to him and curtsied, answering
readily:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I need not that to make me a humble servant
of your Lordship;" but her lips trembled and the
blood was pumping noisily about her ears, and
she found she could speak only in a strained
whisper.</p>

<p>Some of the ladies clapped their hands at her
readiness, and the Baron, with a light laugh, sprang
from his horse and pinned on the badge, taking
as long to do so as he possibly could, while the
others looked on in amusement and made audible
comments, even the ladies chuckling over the
coarse badinage that was bandied about.</p>

<p>"Two groats for the badge, girl," cried one
saucy fellow as the Baron at last reluctantly took
his hands from the girl, and stood off in mock
admiration of his own handiwork, "two groats!"</p>

<p>"I have no money," exclaimed Rose, sullenly.
The interruption had jarred upon her. For a
brief space she had fancied herself and the Baron
alone in the world. De Leaufort turned angrily
upon the fellow. "Who speaks of payment to a
comely maid," he demanded.</p>

<p>"Ay, by St. Clara, a beauty like her needs no
groat in her pocket, for she carries payment ever
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>in her face," spoke up another fellow, who had
been watching the scene with considerable amusement.
"I see the end of poor Lillian's reign," he
muttered in his beard.</p>

<p>The Baron threw an arm about Rose's waist,
and, drawing her to him, pressed a quick hot kiss
on her lips. "I am richly paid," he cried, as she
sprang from him and bounded off through the
woods.</p>

<p>"Richly indeed!" echoed a couple of envious
ones.</p>

<p>"And doubtless the treasury is not yet exhausted,"
laughed one who knew the Baron was
not one to let such a beauty lightly slip through
his fingers.</p>

<p>For an instant de Leaufort looked ruefully
after the girl. She had not seemed to him a girl
that would resent a kiss. At a whisper from a
companion, however, he smiled, nodded his head,
sprang into the saddle, and a moment later
nothing but a cloud of dust rose where the gay
cavalcade had rested. On they proceeded with a
great din and racket, bringing out from every
door they passed heads that shook with disapproval
over the light-hearted gayety of the rich
folks, and their careless misusing of fineries and
good clothes, while the poor had to groan and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>sweat even for such poor rags as they could
find to cover their nakedness.</p>

<p>With the queer contradictions of maidenhood,
which yearns and spurns all of a breath, Rose fled
to her friends only to announce her sudden determination
to return to the Bury the very next day.
To all their pleas to persuade her to remain, she
was obdurate, although a voice deep down within
her pleaded their cause with even far greater eloquence
than they could command. Indeed, no
one could have been more surprised than herself
at the sudden resolution. She had passed hours
before the castle picturing all sorts of wild, impossible
situations with herself as the heroine and the
Baron as the hero, and yet, now that something
had really happened, she ran away. There was
a certain look in the Baron's eyes as his beard
had swept across her cheek that told her with
unfailing instinct that he would not lightly let her
go from him. An exultant subconsciousness
told her that, until he found her, there would be
no woman in the world for him. And yet she
was fleeing from him even as the startled stag at
the scent of danger throws back its antlers and
leaps through the forest. She questioned her
own decision as impatiently as did her friends.
She did not quite understand herself. Was there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>deep down a desire to show her power, to heighten
her charm, by giving him a little trouble in finding
her? She could not say. She was not sure
that she was not playing with her conscience and
making a pretence of saving her soul. She knew
only that a wild desire to run away possessed
her, one too strong to be withstood. She merely
obeyed her reigning impulse as she had done all
her life. With the morrow a new one might
come and then there would be plenty of time to
yield to that.</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>



<h2>XIV</h2>


<p>The day following his interview with Meryl,
Annys was obliged to answer an urgent call from
the men of a hamlet outside of the See of Ely.
These people had refused to pay the tithes due
to the Church, seeing that the rector was a man
who had never seen those parts, and who had long
since rented the church building to a precious
couple who conducted there a highly profitable
tavern.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the strong case which the
people surely had, the Church prepared to wage
a bitter struggle to enforce its rights. For it
would never do in the world to admit the principle
that the people but paid for service rendered.
Indeed, such an admission would end in the bankruptcy
of many an entire diocese. The people
craved the help and advice of Robert Annys.
There was no doubt on which side he would be
found. Meryl accompanied him part of the distance
on his way to Gloucester to confer with the
men of that neighborhood. He had asked for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>some work to do that would help him forget his
keen disappointment and that at the same time
would take him from Matilda's presence. As the
two men separated, they clasped hands warmly,
and Meryl promised to do his utmost to gain
strength and courage to take up again his life at
the Bury. He was determined, however, not to
return until Matilda and the poor priest were
wedded.</p>

<p>Directly on the line of the hamlet where Annys
was awaited, lay Colchester, in the county of Essex,
on the outskirts of which dwelled the wife of the
refugee who had been saved by the devotion of
the Westels. Annys found her on the point of
giving birth to a child, and kept from actual
starvation only by the generosity of those who
had but little more than she. When she learned
from the poor priest that not alone her husband
was safe, but that he was earning fair wages, a
portion of which Annys bore for her in his wallet,
her pinched face brightened. He was strangely
touched by her broken murmurs of gratitude;
never before had an expectant mother appealed
to him in the same way. His heart warmed even
toward the three-year-old fellow who peered at
him dubiously from his mother's skirts. The
knowledge that before long he would take unto
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>himself a wife was a leaven that leavened every
thought and every act.</p>

<p>Although he endured great hardship tramping
along the highway, with little rest and less
food, although he bore with him always the
heavy responsibilities he had assumed, nevertheless
his fortnight of absence sped by as in
a dream. He seemed to move in a new and
strange world. His heart leapt within him
because he experienced a totally new and more
intimate sense of fellowship with the rest of
mankind. There was given him a keener and
profounder insight into their hearts. Scarce
could he keep his eyes from the laborers who
returned at nightfall from the fields and swung
their tots over their heads. He followed funeral
cortèges as they wound over hill and dale with
tears dimming his eyes. A new understanding
of the agony of separation came upon him. He
thought much of his mother, who was but a
beautiful memory to him. He wondered where
she was buried, and resolved to discover her
grave, if possible, and visit it to whisper to her
his new-found happiness.</p>

<p>For there had long been growing within him
the conviction that the Church could not truly
be brought to the people until the clergy became
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>more a part of the people. The clergy could not
truly minister to the people until they understood
the people, until they shared the same hopes and
joys, the same fears and sorrows. The great
emotions that come with family life and family
affections must be brought back to those that
served men. He felt that the very completeness
of the self-surrender that had been demanded by
the early Fathers of the Church had struck a false
note that had rung down the centuries,&mdash;the note
of a cold egoism and isolation of spirit. With all
the strength of his soul he rebelled against the
cruel mandate of St. Jerome, which was responsible
for much that was abnormal in the lives of
the saints:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Though your little nephew twine his arms around your
neck; though your mother, with dishevelled hair and tearing
her robe asunder, point to the breast with which she suckled
you; though your father fall down on the threshold before you,
pass over your father's body. Fly with tearless eyes to the
banner of the cross.... Such chains as these, the love of
God and fear of hell can easily break."</p></div>

<p>This drying up of the commonest sources of
affection, how could it spread the love and fellowship
which were the essence of Christliness?
Even the indomitable believer in celibacy, the
great Hildebrand himself, had said:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>"From love to God to show love to one's
neighbor ... this I consider more than prayers,
fastings, vigils, or other good works."</p></div>

<p>And what so readily and completely opens the
heart to one's neighbor as to live that neighbor's
life?</p>

<p>To watch the love-light of motherhood irradiate
the features of your wife as her new-born babe is
placed within her arms; to watch the shadow of
death creep over the tiny form of the little one
you adore; in short, to suffer, to know, to weep,
to laugh, as others suffer and know, and weep and
laugh&mdash;that, and that only, is to love.</p>

<p>It was a deep-seated satisfaction to him that
love had come to him as he had always prayed
for it,&mdash;a beautiful, spiritual, uplifting experience.
Love, he had always contended, was a holy thing.
Had not Jesus used the simile of the bride and
the bridegroom to express the love of the religious
for her God, of the priest for his Church? Nevertheless,
over all the writings of the Fathers and
the Saints a false and unhealthful asceticism had
spread a morbid view of sexual love. Their pages
were soiled by a horror of passion which in itself
was a surrender to it. The very violence of their
dread, the very vehemence of their agonies, spoke
not only of a lack of self-control, but of a pruriency
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>of imagination which would not have been
present in a normal man. Gone utterly was the
frank cleanness of the Scriptures:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"For he created all things that they might have being, and
the generative powers of the world are healthsome, and there
is no poison of destruction in them."</p></div>

<p>And in its place came a distorted self-consciousness
that was carried to absurd extremes. It
caused one saint to cover his hands with rags
before he would consent to carry his own mother
across a bridge&mdash;a highly edifying incident which
was related with much spiritual gusto by the
saint's biographer.</p>

<p>The tortures of St. Anthony, the revelations
of St. Augustine, the temptations of St. Benedict,
were all to Robert Annys incomprehensible. He
had never known his pulse to bound one beat the
quicker at the sight of a woman. Women there
had been who, stirred by his great beauty, had
striven with such poor art as they possessed to
awaken desire within him, but he had always put
them aside calmly and passed on in the work of
the Lord.</p>

<p>On his return he lost no time in seeking out
Matilda. This time he needed no one to interpret
the joy that surged up into her face as she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>looked on him. He smiled tenderly on her as
she told him of her doings during his absence,
how she had nursed a girl through a terrible
fever, how she had read the Gospel to many eager
souls, how she had taught an old man his letters,
how she had progressed with her grandmother's
lessons. Then when she paused, and asked shyly,
"Did thy pupil well?" he came close to her and
took her hand.</p>

<p>"Well? Why, I could not have done half so
well myself. Ah, I need thee, I need thee always.
What sayst thou? Canst take me, a poor priest
with no better lot to offer thee than that which
my master hath enjoined upon me?"</p>

<p>"I shall love thee the better for it," she whispered.</p>

<p>"It will be no easy life. I will cherish thee
dearly, yet never can I set thy desires above the
call of duty," he said with a certain austereness,
as if, even then, he was replying to the charges of
the Hierarchy.</p>

<p>"I wish to help thee, not to hinder thee," was
her instant reply. And in her face were a faith
and an enthusiasm that would never waver.</p>

<p>"Ah, of a truth!" he said, "had Paul known
thee, never would he have said a married man is
careful only for the things of this world. Surely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>now I shall belong more truly than ever to the
Lord."</p>

<p>He bent over her and kissed her tenderly on
her forehead. Her head, with its smooth, orderly
golden braids, drooped shyly on to his shoulder,
and her heart beat against his. His kiss was
such as a brother bestows on a beloved sister, but
her lips were too pure to know their loss.</p>

<p>He held her to him in sweet content at having
found the wife he had dreamed of. He knew
nothing of the love that burns and scorches, instead
of soothing, and as he felt the deep peace
of being in her presence and feeling her love like
a benediction rest upon him, he marvelled yet
again, as so often he had done in the past, how
the Fathers of the Church could so have maligned
the love of man for woman.</p>

<p>His vision stretched far along the future, seeing
only peace in his life, and the crowning joy of a
woman's touch which blunders not.</p>

<p>"The Lord hath been very gracious unto me,"
he said simply, looking down on her.</p>

<p>Then, at the sound of a light laugh, he turned
and met the eyes of Rose Westel.</p>

<h2>XV</h2>


<p>She made a beautiful picture as she stood
there with an inward tumult chasing the rich
blood in and out her cheeks, and in her eyes a
world of passion and rebellion. Always beautiful,
there was a subtle tremulous excitement
about her now which, as she gazed boldly at the
young poor priest, leapt into his veins as flames
leap into fagots. She was trembling from a
revelation of her own self, and she had flown
home in a wild mood, in which fear and recklessness
and a certain exhilaration from which she
could not escape, all had their part.</p>

<p>She possessed a figure that would have graced
the more flowing robes of the gentles had they
been permitted her, yet her skirt of bright green
was hardly as scant as befitted her station in life.
Her tight-fitting, sleeveless kirtle was of a dull
brown, for she scorned the gown of one color
which was commanded by law. Above the kirtle
shone her bare, white neck. She wore about
her waist a girdle of gold which some great lady
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>had once bestowed upon her, refusing to give it
up even in the face of Parliament, which of late
had protested vigorously against the extravagance
of those who could not afford it, forbidding
to any but a lady of high degree a girdle other
than of plain linen.</p>

<p>From her quick run, the long red cap which
should have covered her ears and neck had become
disarranged, revealing a bit of her hair
which was caught up in a net of wide meshes
and in the sunlight shone like burnished mahogany.
Her large hazel eyes had glints of brilliant
gold at times, her lips were as the scarlet of frost-touched
maples. There was about her a wonderful
glow of vitality. Looking on her, a rush of
life swept over one as a rush of salt-laden air
sweeps over one who stands by the sea. Her
coloring was not like that of any other woman.
Merely to describe it as blonde or brunette would
be like dipping one's brush into a palette of dull
browns to paint the sunset. There was an indescribable
brilliancy about her that made one
think of an October day. She was the incarnation
of the Autumn&mdash;a living, warm, radiant
Autumn; not at all the Autumn of death and
decay, of sobbing winds and whirling leaves, but
a vivid, glowing Autumn, with all its own glory
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>of color, and yet with the freshness and looking-future-ward
of the Spring.</p>

<p>She had been fleeing from a forester who had
been sent in quest of her by the Baron de Leaufort.
He, inflamed by her beauty, set out on a
bit of love-making on his own account. Not a
bad-looking fellow he was in his way, his great
figure set off splendidly by his livery of bright
green, with the baudrick of cardinal tied about
his shoulders and holding his horn. His sword
and buckler hung to one side, and his mighty
bow he bore in his hand, the brilliant peacock
feathers of his arrows peeping from his full
quiver. She had had no eye, however, for his
charms, for her mind was full of the consciousness
that the Baron had sent after her. But
he at her side thought that not even the Lady
Augusta, the Baron's beautiful sister, could compare
with this rustic beauty, not my lady with
her wimple of delicate sheer white stuff and her
flowing robes of royal crimson embroidered with
gold and outlined in ermine. Surely his Lordship
had women in plenty to console himself
with, and besides, he could say he had not been
able to find her.</p>

<p>"By our Lady," he cried, "the Baron should
know enough not to send another hunting for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>him and the game so worth the having. Nay,
'tis not in human nature to expect me to bag you
for him and not have a wee taste for myself."</p>

<p>Rose shrank from his touch. "Nay, be not too
proud, little one. Big Harry hath met many a
fine lady who hath not shrunk from his advances.
A strapping fellow like myself, not so bad-looking,
oft hath his uses not indented in the bond
to his overlord. 'Tis easily accomplished if thou
wilt come with me as my sweetheart; 'tis easy to
tell the Baron that in some way thou hast slipped
through his fingers and cannot be found. By
to-morrow he'll have a dozen making him forget
all about thee."</p>

<p>She suddenly was awake to his meaning.
"Have a care, have a care, fellow," she cried.
"This impudence shall not go unreported, I
promise thee, and thine ears shall ring for it."</p>

<p>In a rage nothing could exceed the girl's beauty.
Quite carried away by it, the fellow seized her
about the waist and kissed her so fiercely and
breathlessly that she could not scream. She felt
herself drawn closer and closer to him, and his
eyes burned into her; she noticed that they swam
wildly in his head and showed their whites like
a man who had lost his reason. As one hand
loosened for an instant, she made a frantic effort
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>of her strength, and slipping from his clasp, she
bounded away like a hare through the woods
before he had recovered from his astonishment.
She rushed on in a wild tumult. It had been
quite different when the Baron had kissed her;
now she felt degraded; tears of indignation and
rage ran down her cheeks. She was furious to
think that a forester of the Baron would dare so
insult her. A forester indeed! That were to
fall lower than her mother. And yet he was a
likely-looking fellow and there was no denying
it, there was something within her that responded
to his wild love-making. As she first
became aware of it she ran harder and harder, as
if she could run away from herself. She wanted
to escape something within her that made her
afraid, but it was of no use, she might as well
face it. She missed the strong pressure of the
fellow's brawny arms; there was a somewhat deep
down within her that wanted to see, just for an
instant again, that peculiar expression in his face,&mdash;a
somewhat that longed for that rain of hot
kisses. There it was out! She had a horror of
herself; on and on she sped, panting, panting.
What was it that had come over her? She had
fled from the fellow, her maidenhood had revolted,
and she had escaped from him, but she could not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>escape from the tumult he had stirred within her.
So, then, she was a woman who could not remain
unresponsive to a man's love-making, no matter
who he be? Oh, shame! shame! was she to burn
at the touch of every clodhopper, she who had
thought herself so immeasurably above them all?
There was no one to tell her that hers was merely
a high-strung, overwrought temperament which
responds when played upon as a delicate instrument
responds to the slightest touch. It was
no more within her power to be indifferent to
the contact with passion than it was within the
power of mercury to refuse to mark the changes
in the temperature.</p>

<p>In this wild mood she had fled to her home, and
come upon the young poor priest with his arm
about her cousin. "Always love-making, love-making,"
she thought, "no end to it all." And
yet this was no wild paroxysm before her, but a
picture of calm joy and peace. Dimly she realized
even then that to waken such love was not in her
power, and for the first time in her life she caught
herself actually envying her cousin Matilda.</p>

<p>"This is my cousin Rose," said Matilda. And
then flinging both arms about Rose, she whispered
in her ear, "Just think! We are going to
be married. I must tell thee."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>
<p>Rose smiled. She thought few would be
surprised. She took Robert's hand in hers and
clasped it warmly.</p>

<p>"She is a dear good girl," she said. "You
will be very happy."</p>

<p>He found no answer on his tongue, and although
he was fully conscious of the absurdity of it, he
immediately proposed that Matilda bring the
Bible and that they see how much progress she
had made during his absence. He politely invited
Rose to listen and to Matilda's surprise she
readily acquiesced, she who had always scoffed
at their Bible reading. Only she begged that
the poor priest read instead of Matilda.</p>

<p>So in his exquisitely modulated voice he began:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"For the sovereign Lord of all will not refrain himself for
any man's person, neither will he reverence greatness, because
it is he that made both small and great."</p></div>

<p>But while his lips uttered those words his heart
sang:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">"Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet,</div>
      <div class="verse">And thy mouth is comely:</div>
      <div class="verse">Thou art all fair, my love;</div>
      <div class="verse">And there is no spot in thee."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>When Matilda started up, suddenly saying she
had heard the voice of her grandmother calling,
the heavy folio slipped unheeded from his knee,
and he gazed steadily at Rose with eyes that bore
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>a look as if a thick veil had suddenly fallen from
them. There was a world of pathos in his face,
for he realized, even as he gazed on her, that
nothing again could ever look to him as it had
looked before this moment had come. Rose had
watched him furtively while he read, surprised to
find him so handsome. She had never seen him
other than at a distance, for his coarse russet
gown had repelled her. But now she observed
with astonishment how beautiful were his deep-set,
blue eyes, how noble his high forehead, how
exquisitely moulded his lips and chin, how proud
the carriage of his head. Everything about him,
even his slender, delicate hands, spoke of a refinement
far beyond even that of the Baron, for all
his silks and embroideries. Prim little Matilda
was not so foolish, then, after all!</p>

<p>As he looked on her, he saw with bewilderment
all his well-laid plans come crashing to the ground.
He had been so sure of himself (but self-pride
had ever been his besetting sin). Here was a lesson
in humility, indeed! He understand the love
of a woman! He, forsooth, an ignorant youngster!
He, who but a half-hour ago (when he
had been ages younger) had been willing to lay
down the law to saints and martyrs! Ignoramus!
Had he not held a woman's form to his and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>praised God that his heart had not beat one stroke
the quicker? Had not he pressed a kiss on a
woman's brow and been thankful that there had
been no unchaste thrill? Well did he know now
with a sudden revelation that he could not so
much as touch this woman's hand but the blood
would mount like strong wine to his head. There
was a touch of solemnity in his eyes as they rested
on the face that was teaching him so much.
When at last she stirred uneasily under his persistent
gaze, it seemed to him as if hours, months,&mdash;years,
had passed.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">"Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, my bride;</div>
      <div class="verse">Thou has ravished my heart</div>
      <div class="verse">With one look from thine eyes.</div>
      <div class="verse">With one chain of thy neck."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>She started at the low words which seemed to
escape him involuntarily. Annys continued to
gaze gravely on her, and came near to her.</p>

<p>"Why didst thou come into my life?" he asked
quietly.</p>

<p>Then after an instant's pause for the reply
which did not come, he added hopelessly, with a
weary sigh, "I had thought myself so happy."</p>

<p>And then without one word more he was gone.</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>



<h2>XVI</h2>


<p>The following morning, as Matilda accompanied
Annys on an errand of mercy, she noticed his
haggard face.</p>

<p>"I have passed the night in prayer," was all
he vouchsafed to her anxious inquiries. He did
not tell her what his prayer had been. Indeed,
now that the morning had come, and Matilda
was by his side, the long, sleepless night seemed
as an evil dream.</p>

<p>They were on their way to an old man who
was lying on the point of death, kept alive only
by his strong yearning to be shrived by Robert
Annys. Matilda had paid daily visits to the
old man during the poor priest's absence. As
Annys looked down on the good, strong woman
by his side, he felt himself possessed by a new
strength. He believed he would be able to shake
off the spell that had come over him. He must
keep near Matilda, he must not let her go from
him. There was medicine in her perfect companionship.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>
<p>As they paused before a dilapidated house on
the edge of the woods, Rose came by.</p>

<p>"Ever going about comforting others," she
hailed them in her light way; "in truth, wings will
yet grow on the pair of you."</p>

<p>Matilda laughed, but Annys kept his eyes
gravely on the door which stood ajar before him.
A horrid, gasping sound came from within. Rose
shuddered. "Ugh!" she cried, "how canst thou,
Matilda, poke about in those filthy places? See,
it is a perfect day. Come with me into the woods
and go nutting."</p>

<p>Then as Matilda shook her head, she added in
a sanctimonious tone, "Hast no pity for the poor
nuts a-rotting on the cold hard ground?"</p>

<p>The words were addressed to Matilda, yet the
man by her side read the invitation in them, his
senses all astir.</p>

<p>"Oh, Rose, Rose," expostulated Matilda, "thou
dost love to make thyself out far worse than thou
art. Cease these gibes and enter with us; a sight
of thy pretty face will gladden the poor soul."</p>

<p>But a look of disgust passed over Rose's face.
"Go in there? I? B'r'r! Go near that horrid
old man who fastens one rheumy eye on you while
his slobbery chin shakes like a huge jelly? B'r'r!"</p>

<p>Annys's face was tense and hard. He never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>turned his eyes from the door, yet the golden
brown of her dancing eyes quivered before him,
the scarlet of her full lips scorched into him. He
was aware of every inch of her disdainful, impish
presence as she stood there watching him from a
corner of one eye. But without turning he bade
Matilda follow him, and the two were swallowed
up in the dim interior of the hovel. The girl
outside shook with suppressed laughter, yet she
bit her lip in some impatience and puffed out her
cheeks in an odd little grimace.</p>

<p>Within, the old man lavishly poured blessings
upon them both; upon Matilda for keeping her
promise to bring the poor priest, upon him for
coming.</p>

<p>"Never would I have seen this day," he declared,
"but for her. She did come every day,
cheering me and helping me wait."</p>

<p>Annys smiled tenderly on Matilda who stood
blushing by his side. But even as he smiled, he
was conscious of a strange red glow dancing
before his eyes. Suddenly the old man sat up,
and seizing Matilda's hand in his bony fingers,
placed it within the poor priest's hand.</p>

<p>"That is right," he whispered as he did so.
"Bless you both&mdash;a pair of saints!"</p>

<p>Annys started violently and snatched his hand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>away before he was aware of it. He was maddened
by that glow which was everywhere, on
the walls, on Matilda, on the straw where the old
man lay, on the ghastly, emaciated face. He
tried to recover his composure and sought to
take Matilda's hand and press it, but she was
visibly offended and withdrew from the bedside.</p>

<p>The invalid's sudden spark of vitality died
down, leaving him barely conscious. Matilda
left sadly, and Annys sank on his knees by the
pallet, praying for the departing soul. When, half
an hour later, he left the hut, it was to walk to the
other end of the village where another sufferer
awaited him. He walked on, his head bowed.
He tried to fix his thoughts on the patient young
girl whose last hours he was about to soothe, but
the face that hovered before him had none of the
pallor of death. Suddenly he was roused by a
slight stirring before him, and he looked up startled
to find himself in the thick of the woods,
under a great chestnut tree, while before him was
the bent form of Rose, gathering the nuts into a
little basket. So, then, his feet had carried him
there to her against his will! His face was even
a shade paler than its wont, and his hands were
clenched fiercely, as he turned about and walked
rapidly in the opposite direction.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>
<p>He had not been quick enough, however, to
escape being seen, for as he left, the girl straightened
herself and gazed after him. For a few
seconds her shoulders shook with laughter, then
suddenly her face sobered, and she bit her lips in
vexation.</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>



<h2>XVII</h2>


<p>All that day and night Matilda brooded over
Robert's strange behavior. Nevertheless, she
greeted him calmly when, the next day, he approached
while she was busily spinning before
her door. Seeing Rose lying full length upon
the grass, idly plucking handfuls of it and flinging
them at Matilda, he hesitated. "Why do the
feet of a lover lag?" Rose asked, impudently
looking up at Annys. Matilda colored. She
talked with Annys, while Rose looked on with
an amused air. "Ah, Matilda, dear," she began
after an instant, "after all, didst thou well to
plight thy troth to a poor priest?"</p>

<p>"Wilt ever be serious?" asked her cousin,
annoyed.</p>

<p>"I am as serious as a Bishop," she replied.
"Indeed I have not seen him kiss thee once. Of
a truth I have not."</p>

<p>Matilda vowed she would leave if another word
were said of such nonsense. Rose smiled maliciously
and watched the poor priest's set face,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>while all sorts of pert sayings hovered on the
end of her tongue.</p>

<p>"Old Silas died," announced Annys, gravely,
"I have just come from there."</p>

<p>"And how is dear Betty?"</p>

<p>"I did not get to her last night," he said in
some confusion. Rose laughed to herself. Matilda
looked grieved. "Ah, the poor girl!" she
said, "she longed for you so."</p>

<p>"Oh, these lovers will be the death of me!"
broke out Rose, no longer able to contain herself.
"Were I blessed with a lover, now, I vow
it would not be of corpses and dying girls we
would talk!"</p>

<p>"Be quiet, Rose!" exclaimed Matilda, sternly
for her, "we talk of serious things."</p>

<p>"That's what I complain of!" pouted the irrepressible
girl.</p>

<p>Matilda and Annys spoke together a few minutes
in whispers.</p>

<p>At last flinging a handful of grass straight at
him:&mdash;</p>

<p>"When will be the happy day?" she drawled.</p>

<p>He started nervously. "I have a journey to
take," he said in a strained voice. "I leave
to-morrow. I do not know just when I can return."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>
<p>Rose's eyebrows lifted in surprise. Matilda
regarded him anxiously.</p>

<p>"Yea, I have received an urgent call. I had
come to tell thee."</p>

<p>But there had been no call, and Rose's mocking
eyes seemed to read his subterfuge.</p>

<p>"Wilt return for the Fair?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Surely," he answered, "I have promised to be
there. Men will gather there from every county."</p>

<p>"I will be there," she announced quickly, and
then laughed to see the dismay in his face.</p>

<p>"And Matilda, too, surely?" he hastened to
ask. But Matilda shook her head.</p>

<p>"I may not be spared," she said gently.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, Matilda is the saint. I am the
selfish, wilful one," laughed Rose, who seemed
determined to make Annys uncomfortable.</p>

<p>"I must go to Betty now," Annys said.
"Good-by, Matilda, I shall see thee soon again&mdash;immediately
after the Fair." He kissed her
on the forehead, and for the first time he felt her
shrink from his touch.</p>

<p>"Be <em>sure</em> to return in time from that <em>important</em>
mission!" Rose called after him. And Matilda
looked at her, wondering.</p>

<p>He walked rapidly on, his mind in a whirl,
taking no note of where he was going. That
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>sudden, unpremeditated lie agonized him. And
yet, perhaps, after all, this lie would be his salvation.
Perhaps once away from that girl with her
maddening beauty he could cast off the spell she
had wrought upon him. It was a daily torture
to meet Matilda with a lie on his heart, to meet
Rose was but a torture of another kind. Yes,
he would go away for a brief spell.</p>

<p>Suddenly he found himself before the walls of
the Monastery of the Bury St. Edmonds. For the
first time he longed for the peace that was there.
There, before him, was but the thickness of a few
stones, and yet the men behind it, how immeasurably
separated were they from the rest of the
world! All the forces of nature&mdash;chains of
mountains and the turbulent streams of the forests&mdash;had
not in them the powers of isolation
that rested in that wall erected by the hand of
man. He stood without, in the midst of the
strenuousness, the revolt, the passion, and sorrow
of the world: they within were taken up and cared
for as little children in the lap of some great-hearted
Mother. The world and its ways and all
worldliness went on far from them, and no sound
of the battle of the forces, good and evil, ever
was heard. An orderly and unbroken succession
of tasks was laid out for them. They had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>no difficult problems to weigh, no decisions to
make. Ah, how he envied them for that! There
was no fretting over the duty of the morrow or the
day after the morrow, the mind was kept fixed on
the duty of the moment; from this one passed
imperceptibly to the duty of the hour, to the duty
of the day. From Matin to Prime and from
Prime to Tierce, from Tierce to Sexte, and Sexte
to None, and again to Vespers and on to Compline,
certain tasks that in no case may be missed
or deferred: prayers to be chanted during the
day; one hundred and fifty psalms of David
divided so that the whole psalter should be
chanted every week; the taking one's turn to be
cook, or to wait upon the table in the refectory,
or to read from some pious book while the others
ate in silence. So, calmly, unresisting, one slipped
down the gentle slope to death.</p>

<p>Ah, no wonder Alcuin had passionately lamented
his cloister when he was called to the
court of Charlemagne:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">"Oh, my sweet cell! and well-beloved home. Adieu forever!</div>
      <div class="verse">Dear cell! I shall weep thee and regret thee always."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>But the solace of even a short sojourn within
a Monastery was denied him&mdash;the excommunicated
one. It had been easy for him to fling
defiance to the Church when upheld by his sense
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>of righteousness, but now, no longer sinless, he
yearned to kneel before the altar and be shrived.</p>

<p>In the course of his life it had come to him to
determine what was the right thing to do&mdash;there
had never been a question of knowing the right
and not doing it. Now the right path lay clearly
defined, without the slightest doubt, yet it was
to be a life and death struggle to follow it. During
the past few days he had pored for hours at a
time over the "Lives of the Saints," reading again
and again their denunciations of women, hoping
to strengthen his purpose to prove that the love
of woman could be pure. It was his most deeply
cherished hope that his example in taking a wife
like Matilda would lead to the establishment of
a married clergy. Up to this moment, knowing
the purity and nobility of his motives, he had not
shrunk from the indignation of the Churchmen
that was sure to break forth on his taking a
woman openly in wedlock. And now he was
obliged to admit to himself that he loved a
woman whom it would be impossible to marry.
Impossible because of his plighted troth to Matilda,
but also&mdash;and that hurt deeper&mdash;because
she was surely no ideal priest's wife. His high
and mighty theories on the marriage of the clergy
must vanish into thin air if he held up Rose as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>a proper spouse for a priest of God. Rose to
kneel before the leper and wash his feet! Rose
to enter the homes of the afflicted and hunger-stricken
and bring them comfort! No, there was
nothing gained by trying to shut his eyes to the
truth. He loved a woman who could not further
one strong hope of his soul, who could not answer
to one noble impulse.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Give not thy soul unto a woman, that she should set her
foot upon thy strength."</p></div>

<p>But that was precisely what he had done.
Every argument proved conclusively that he
never ought to see Rose Westel again. But one
might as well seek by argument to stop a raging
flood from bearing down upon one as to attempt
to argue away an emotion. There was no need
to convince him that he ought to hate the woman
who had so suddenly wrought ruin upon his most
cherished hopes. A part of him did hate her&mdash;the
rest of him adored.</p>

<p>There was prayer left to him. He had tried
prayer with all the fervor of his tortured soul.
The night before, following the advice of one of
the Fathers, he had passed upon his knees reiterating
only the one phrase,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse indent6">"<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Deus meus et Omnia</span>."</div>
      <div class="verse">"My God and my All, My God and my All."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>
<p>His heart was overshadowed by the thought
that God had surely withdrawn His love from him
or He could not permit him to suffer so. Again
and again he had flung himself on his knees and
sobbed out the prayer uttered by St. Augustine
when he was endeavoring to overcome the ways
of his youth:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Thou, my Lord, how long yet? O Lord, how long yet
wilt thou be angry? How long? How long? Why not in
this hour put an end to my shame?"</p></div>

<p>It was easy when alone to ponder over such
words as those of St. Jerome:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Love the knowledge of the Scriptures and thou wilt not
love the lusts of the flesh."</p></div>

<p>It was easy to feel the truth of St. Dominic's
admonition:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"A man who governs his passions is master of the world.
We must either command them or be enslaved to them. It is
better to be the hammer than the anvil."</p></div>

<p>All very admirable, yet they were but words,
words, words. Excellent counsellings, wise reasonings,
they were, but could they master one
wild throb of his veins leaping in her presence?
Could they make the vision of her one whit less
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>radiant and compelling? Had he created the
world? Was it his fault or the fault of the
Creator of all things that this great longing for
her held him in subjection, and that until that was
satisfied there was no peace for him in all the wide,
wide world? The wildest thoughts ran through
his mind at times. It was not too late, he would
recant, and go back and enter the Church, and
become a great and powerful prelate. He could
yet live in a palace and offer her a fitting setting for
her glorious beauty. If he closed his eyes he never
failed to see himself in magnificent robes seated at
the centre of the great table with her at his side.
He could see the gleam of jewels as they rose and
fell on her white bosom; he could see the light in
her eyes as she turned toward him; he could feel
the thrill from the touch of her soft white hands.</p>

<p>Yes, it was best to go and strive with all his
might to forget Rose Westel, and return to the
Bury with his honor unstained, return to keep
his troth with Matilda.</p>

<p>He had promised to return immediately after
the Fair. This great Fair of Stourbridge had
for over a year been looked to as an important
meeting place before the final rendezvous at
Blackheath. It lacked now but a few days before
its opening, for over a fortnight past it had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>officially proclaimed by officers going about the
country forbidding any merchant to sell or exhibit
for sale any goods in any place for a distance of
seven leagues about, except inside the gates of
the Fair.</p>

<p>Inside these gates there would be gathered
people from leagues away on every side. It would
be a precious opportunity, for in no wise else might
the people gather together in great numbers without
exciting suspicion. Here at the Fair, under
the pretence of buying and trading, the most important
conferences could take place, final arrangements
for the great gathering be talked over, and
the march on to the Maidstone gaol with ten
thousand of men as Ball had foretold could be
planned. Here minstrels could go about singing
the songs that set the blood of the rustics
a-tingling, so that they might be heartened for
the long hard winter that yet lay before them.</p>

<h2>XVIII</h2>


<p>The morning of the opening of the Fair found
Annys, together with hundreds of others, tramping
along the road to Stourbridge. From the very
earliest sign of dawn the highway had bustled
with life. The people poured in from all sides,&mdash;from
as far north as Norwich and Kings Lynn
and Marham, and from Colchester and Mile End
in the east, and Oxford in the west, and Maidstone
and Tunbridge and Guildford in the south,
and even from the great city of London they
came. For weeks the whole southeast corner of
England had been in a turmoil of preparation.
The harbors of the seaport towns, Blakeney and
Colchester and Lynn and Norwich, had been filled
with foreign vessels, swarming with swarthy-faced
sailors from the Mediterranean and tow-haired
sailors from the North Sea. All these were doubly
welcome, for not only they brought trade to the
towns, but news, news of far-off lands and far-off
peoples. The relation of man to man had a
freshness, a piquancy in those days, for one told
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>the other of what was happening in the world,
and so each man was then a bearer of news, and
not a mere commentator on news already known.</p>

<p>Walking along the highway and jostling one
another, there were to be found belated merchants,
with heavy hearts hurrying to plead for
a place in the Fair; bailiffs bent on their masters'
business, securing more canvas or the best millstones
from the south of France, or horses for
the field, or any of the thousand things that it
was their duty to see were on hand; nobles themselves
travelling in great state to select a fine war-horse
from Spain, or from the same land some
rich, rare wine with the sun taken prisoner in it;
some knight to try curiously wrought armor
from Milan; ladies on palfreys with their hearts
set on some jewels or fine robes; monks telling
their beads; nuns with eyes modestly cast down;
smiths seeking for iron; pardoners and pedlers
seeking for profit, acrobats and showmen all after
the careless penny of the loiterer; beggars in
plenty; scholars from the Universities;&mdash;as the
poet sang,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"All manner of men, the mean and the rich, working and
wandering as the world asketh."</p></div>

<p>Once within the gates, Annys found himself
surrounded by a most bewildering Babel,&mdash;merchants
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>crying their wares, jugglers proclaiming
their feats, drug-sellers holding forth on the
peculiar virtues of their medicines and ointments,
pardoners praising their charms, swine grunting
disapproval, horses neighing with impatience, girls
exclaiming in delight and wonder, boys tooting
tin horns, deep voices, shrill voices, laughs, sneers,
jests, oaths, upbraidings, crowing, gobbling, stamping,
halloes,&mdash;Italian, Norwegian, Russian, Dutch,
German, French, Spanish, and English all jumbled
together. It was enough to madden a man,
unless he plunged into the immediate work of
making as much noise as his neighbor. Yet the
vast majority seemed in good spirits, and many
articles changed hands, and all went merrily
enough; and if some dispute did wax too high for
comfort, the brawlers were led in a trice to the
court of the dusty feet, where either the dignified
Mayor of Cambridge or his deputy sat all day
and all night, and woe to the man that thought
there was appeal from his decision.</p>

<p>Annys looked about him with great interest.
A great cornfield half a mile square had been
dug up and laid out into streets. The owner of
the corn had hurried in his harvest before the
last week in August, for had he been caught with
his corn still on the stalk, the builder of the booths
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>then had the right to destroy the corn. On the
other hand, when the Fair was over it was the
turn of the builder to hasten, for if the booths
were not removed before Michaelmas day, the
owner of the soil had the right to destroy them.
Turn about is fair play. The only compensation
which the owner of the land received for the use
of his land was its additional fertility after so
large a concourse of persons had thronged there.</p>

<p>Each important trade had its own street or
double row of booths, with a sign swinging high
with the name of the street painted conspicuously
upon it. As the name was in each case borrowed
for the occasion from some town street where the
trade was permanently concentrated, there was
brought to the little English village a quaint
flavor of cosmopolitanism. Memories of London
and Bruges and Paris and Venice stirred in the
breeze. For a time Annys walked up and down,
so much interested in what he saw that he neglected
to look for the signal with which the members
of the secret society always greeted one
another. There was something marvellously exhilarating
to him in this contact with men from
all parts of the world. Here was a man who, but
a few months ago, might have kneeled before the
throne of the Pope, and here was another who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>might have come straight from the luxurious palace
at Avignon, where the Anti-pope held his
court. Here was one whose ancestors surely
saw the red cross of the Crusaders waving at
the gates of Palestine, and here one who had
within him the blood of those hardy Norsemen
who descended upon the English coast with all
the fury and compelling force of the fierce storms
that drove along their boats.</p>

<p>He walked through one street after another,
never tiring of the wonderful sights. He stopped
before the booths and stood gaping like a little
child, receiving, however, scant enough encouragement
from the merchants, who would have
preferred to give ground space to a customer
more profitable than a poor priest. There were
streets where merchants with precious stocks of
Eastern produce vied with one another, Venetians
and Genoese, to attract the eye of the connoisseur;
others where Italian silks and velvets
tempted the rich; and others yet where delicate
glassware dazzled the eye with glints of exquisite
color. And still more merchants from Italy
showed spices as their bait,&mdash;spices without
which no meal were palatable,&mdash;pepper and cinnamon,
mace and ginger, cloves, and canel, collected
in the far East, and reaching the Mediterranean
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>only after a long and tedious journey. Then
there were men from the south of France, and
Greeks as well, with raisins, figs, currants, galingale,
almonds, rice, and licorice. And there were
dates from Egypt and sugars from Sicily and
Cyprus and Alexandria.</p>

<p>Gascons there were who needed not their celebrated
wines to make them expansive and good-humored;
big-boned men from the Hanseatic
towns with furs and amber beads and precious
stones from the East, reaching them from Moscow
and Novgorod; and Flemish weavers with
the coveted linens of Liège and Ghent; and
hardy Norwegians with tar and pitch from their
unending forests of pine.</p>

<p>All this had been brought to England's shores
in many vessels, reaching Stourbridge in smaller
boats by way of the rivers Ouse and Cam; but
from England itself there had come, first in importance,
the great wool packs that were the envy
of other nations, and tin from the mines of Cornwall,
lead from the mines of Derbyshire, iron from
the forges of Sussex, and, most important, salt
from the springs of Worcestershire; for woe to
the bailiff who fell short of salt for his stock!</p>

<p>How Annys revelled in all this tumult and
bustle of trade! The struggle which he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>waged with himself had drawn his thoughts away
from their usual current, but now his heart within
him panted for action. The longing for the
peace of the monastery faded away utterly, and
in its place arose the strong joy of living, of
fighting, of sharing one's life with a brother, and
of living for that brother&mdash;which was the very
essence of his creed. He had passed through an
evil nightmare. He was awake now, and he drew
deep breaths to know that he was a free man again;
and now he looked eagerly about him for a sign
of a familiar face, for he could scarce wait until he
should begin planning and discussing again the
details of the great rendezvous at Blackheath.</p>

<p>Suddenly he found that it was impossible to
make further headway, for the crowd pressed too
thickly about him. He allowed himself to be
pushed along until, by craning his neck, he could
see what was the cause of the excitement.</p>

<p>A man standing upon a carpeted platform was
vehemently holding forth upon the virtues of his
wares. The crowd could not catch all that he
was saying.</p>

<p>"Hush! hush!"</p>

<p>"Let us hear what he has to say!"</p>

<p>"Quiet! quiet!"</p>

<p>"Here it is, here it is, my good fellows," the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>man was saying, in a loud, singsong voice. "Do
not lose this precious opportunity of protecting
yourselves at a trifling cost against all sickness
and pestilence. Look! you see it is still red and
flowing, after all these years, which proves it is as
I say. It can never congeal." And he held high
above their heads, so that all might see, a small
vial with some red fluid shaking in it. "This is
some of the precious blood of Christ, caught while
it was dripping away from Him on the cross.
Remember, no one can be taken with the black
vomit while in the possession of this vial."</p>

<p>A man stepped forward and purchased the
precious vial, not, however, without some sharp
haggling over its price.</p>

<p>"And now," continued the pardoner, seeing
that he had attracted a sufficient crowd about
him, "and now do I not see some youth who has
loved more hotly than wisely, and who would like
a charm to spare the maid all pain? Here is an
Agnus Dei," he cried, holding up a small wax
medal. "Remember, it will be six years more
before his most Holy Reverence, the Pope,
blesses a new stock; remember, the possession
of this wipes away sin; it protects one from the
fury of winds and tempests, and one cannot be
hurt even by fire."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>
<p>"Sell it not, then, O monk, I beg," cried a
voice from the crowd, "for it may come of great
use to you in the future life."</p>

<p>The monk grinned in appreciation of the joke.
"But I could not find it in my heart to keep it
from yonder young man who needs it so sorely
for his sweetheart."</p>

<p>All eyes turned curiously towards a stalwart
young fellow who was trying to escape with a
buxom young woman clinging to his arm. It
was evident that the monk's shrewd eyes had read
the situation rightly, and as no joke was too
coarse for a mediæval crowd, the merriment was
quite open and unconcealed. The fellow looked
sheepish, the girl's face was aflame and the tears
stood in her eyes, yet the crowd guffawed heartily.
"Remember," cried the monk in one more
desperate attempt, "in accouchement, mother and
infant both are saved," but the couple had succeeded
in making their escape.</p>

<p>"Hold!" exclaimed a stout and prosperous-looking
merchant, "must all the world give way
before lovers? I, too, have my needs, for I brave
many a tempest in the course of my wanderings."</p>

<p>"Ay," replied the monk, "take it for safe travel,
and it is well to remember that it will take a
certain temptation of the flesh away from thee,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>and the Lord knows there is evil enough in the
world."</p>

<p>Then he singled out a big bailiff who looked as
if he lived off the fat of his master's land, and
endeavored to sell him a scapular which if worn
over the back and stomach insured perfect continency,
incidentally at the same time protecting
the wearer from all the torments of Hell, powers
of the Evil One, etc., etc. The crowd roared with
delight over the discomfiture of the bailiff, whose
puffy cheeks became purple with anger.</p>

<p>"Ho, ho!" they cried, "take it, Sir Bailiff, and
mend thy ways. 'Tis known thy knees are already
worn with praying for what the scapular will
accomplish without further effort on thy part."</p>

<p>"Here," cried the bailiff, throwing the monk a
coin, "enough! I'll pay for it, but it suits not
the temper of my blood. Throw it, instead, and
welcome, over the shoulders of yonder poor priest
who looks as if it would not trouble him any to
go without certain good things of life."</p>

<p>The crowd turned about and craned their necks
to have a good look at Annys, who merely smiled
and suggested that it be not wasted on one who
did not need it. Then the monk caught sight of
him for the first time.</p>

<p>"Oh, good morrow, 'tis my famous pontiff, good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>morrow," he cried. Annys nodded shortly in
return to Stott, whom he had long before recognized,
and tried to pass on. He had witnessed
enough of the superstition and folly of the people,
and his heart was heavy within him. But Stott
would not have it so. "Ah, Sir Russet-priest,"
he called after him, "I wot well you do not
approve of all this, yet have you it in your heart
to turn away as I am about to offer my very
choicest treasure of all?"</p>

<p>The crowd squeezed closer to the carpeted platform,
and Annys could not have made his way
through now had he wished to. A thin, anxious-looking
merchant, in his stall opposite, who had
come from afar and saw that his wares were not
going as were the wares of this pardon-seller,
looked on sadly and murmured impatiently in his
beard against all pardon-sellers and humbugs.</p>

<p>"Now give heed, dear people," began Stott
in an unctuous tone, and from the manner in
which the words rolled easily from his tongue it
was evident that he had often recited the story
before.</p>

<p>"Ye have all heard of the Blessed Virgin sister
Jeanne of the Cross of the third order of St. Francis,
and of her great piousness, and in what great reverence
she was held, and how all the birds flocked to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>hear her preach, and when she prayed the flowers
in the vases bowed at the Gloria Patri."</p>

<p>How the simple people delighted in those tales!
Indeed, the highly diverting tales of the saints and
the miracles that they performed were to them
novels, dramas, and exhortations all in one. Their
imaginative curiosity was captivated at the same
time that their faith was strengthened.</p>

<p>"Well, one day the nuns came to her, who was
their Mother Superior, and begged her to obtain
the blessing of Jesus Christ Himself for their rosaries.
So she placed all that they gave to her in
a great casket which she locked securely, retaining
the key of it herself. The next day all the
rosaries were gone and the casket perfectly empty.
Then, while the Virgin remained on her knees
praying, the chapel was suddenly filled with the
most delicious and wonderful odor, and on going
to the casket they found the rosaries again there."</p>

<p>A shiver of interest ran through the audience.
They listened as children listen to some delightful
fairy tale, the more familiar, the more delightful.</p>

<p>"Now it is well known," continued the monk,
"that a very special grace is attached to these rosaries,
not only to all the rosaries blessed by Christ
Himself, but to each individual bead of each rosary."</p>

<p>Annys wondered if the fellow would have the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>effrontery to pretend that he had with him one
of those rosaries, which were so precious as to be
guarded night and day in the chapel, as, indeed, if
they were stolen the principal source of the monastery's
income would go with them. Stott's
beady little eyes twinkled as if he read the
thought of his critic. They seemed to say, "Not
so fast, Sir Russet-priest, wait a bit!"</p>

<p>"Now follow me carefully," he went on; "recollect
that by the peculiar virtues of these beads
the same virtue passes out to every bead that
touches one of them. These rosaries which I
have here have lain for one whole night in the
casket with the original beads."</p>

<p>Annys could not but laugh at the ingenuity of
the fellow, and he now passed slowly on, while
behind him he could for some time hear the harsh,
monotonous voice reciting:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It quiets storms, cures pestilence, prevents
temptations against the Faith, puts out flames."</p>

<p>"Ha!" exclaimed a stalwart smith, recognizing
Annys and bringing one great hand down
on his slender shoulder so that the young man
winced. "Ha, does it so? Puts out flames?
Then these bailiffs here, if they know their business,
will not lose a minute in securing them
for their masters, and it might be well for every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>Baron and Abbott in the land to get one, for, by
Heaven, if&mdash;"</p>

<p>The rest was lost in Annys's hand, which he
closed tightly over the smith's mouth.</p>

<p>"Hist!" he cried at the same time, with a
warning gesture.</p>

<p>"Oh, I am heartily sick of caution," cried the
smith, "my hand itches for the torch. It cannot
be laid on too soon for me."</p>

<p>"Nay," Annys exclaimed, "the torch would be
but a poor friend indeed. But come where we
can talk more privily. A little patience, my
friend."</p>

<p>"Oh, patience, patience," cried the fellow, bitterly,
but striding after the poor priest.</p>

<p>"A pardon, a pardon," begged a poor woman,
approaching Annys with outstretched palm.</p>

<p>Annys smiled and handed her one which she
took eagerly.</p>

<p>Later on, it caused much discussion, for when
its Latin was translated it proved to be no pardon
at all. He had given her a piece of paper on
which was written:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Et qui bona egerunt ibunt in vitam eternam</span>."</p></div>

<p>It looked proper enough and like unto the usual
Latin prayer that was written on such pardons,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>but in plain English it turned out to be only a
homely piece of advice taken from Piers the
Ploughman:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Those who do well shall go into everlasting life."</p></div>

<p>These russet priests! There's no telling the
tricks they will play!</p>

<h2>XIX</h2>


<p>The two made their way, not without some
difficulty, towards the part of the fair grounds
where the sheep were for sale. This was the
spot selected by the leaders of the rebellion.
Merchants and chapmen on all sides of them
were shouting encouragement for the passers-by
to stop and purchase of them.</p>

<p>"Wimples, wimples! Sure 'tis not in thy heart
to refuse thy lass to bind up her pretty hair with
one of these."</p>

<p>"Girdles! here they are, silver and gold of the
finest."</p>

<p>"Crosses, crosses, jewelled, inlaid, carved ivory
crucifixes. Here is a glowing gem for my lady's
prie-dieux."</p>

<p>"Here, Sir Knight, give this altar cloth to Holy
Church and receive many days' grace for it&mdash;one
day for each thread in this golden fringe."</p>

<p>"Furs, furs, the cold winter will soon be upon
us. Overlook not my choice stock of ermines
and beaver."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>
<p>"Faugh!" cried a man passing by. "'Cold
winter,' indeed; one would think to hear these
fellows that the aim of the great folks is to keep
warm with the fur they pile upon their garments."</p>

<p>"Well, mayhap they try to keep warm the
ground," joined in another, "for they do stick
their furs about the tails of their gowns instead
of about their necks and wrists, where there would
be some sense to it."</p>

<p>"Talking of tails," grinned a man who was a
tailor by trade, "why, it will come about shortly
that no workshop in all the land will be large
enough to cut out a fine robe if the trains grow
much longer. We shall all of us have to take
to the fields to cut out our gowns."</p>

<p>"Indeed," said another, "I cannot for the life
of me see any reason for the wearing of fur save it
is as a hiding-place for fleas."</p>

<p>"There you are in error," retorted the tailor,
who was also a bit of a philosopher; "you forget
that it is forbidden by law to all but the great
folk to wear fur, ergo do not say that it hath no
uses. Remember an article is prized just so far
as it is difficult for others to get it."</p>

<p>The voices of the merchants, always persuasive,
continued to reach Annys and his companion.
"Here you are, my beauties. Don't pass by.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>Here is the famous recipe to keep the skin ever
white and smooth, of sweet almonds blanched, of
gum dragant and of gum arabic, of the flower of
beans, of the root of the fleur-de-lis, of dried fish
glue&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Give not away all thy secrets, fellow," interrupted
a passer-by, with a laugh; "we can all go
home and make up thy recipe for ourselves."</p>

<p>"Ah, but you will not know the correct proportions,
and without that the virtue of the compound
is not there," replied the man, no whit
disconcerted.</p>

<p>"Ointments, ointments, rare and precious ointments,"
cried a rival, "musks, vermillion lip salves,
clothes of pure scarlet dye to keep the cheeks ever
young. Ah, lass, just approach here and see if a
touch of this on thy cheeks does not make thy
fellow come hurrying back to thee."</p>

<p>"Waters of daffodils," from the other side.</p>

<p>"Grape juice and tarragon mixed, sweet waters
of oranges, roses, jessamine," flung back from
opposite.</p>

<p>And at last they heard about them the kind of talk
that showed they had reached their destination.</p>

<p>"Nay, I have rubbed my fingers off me and the
skin yet keeps pale. I tell ye 'tis rotten, and I'll
none of it."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>
<p>"Why, man, look you, pull on that wool, and
you could not tear it, had you the strength of
Hercules."</p>

<p>"If the hoar frost of the morning melt on the
wool, be sure there is an unnatural heat somewhere."</p>

<p>"I tell you the veins under the eyes are white.
Do you need further proof?"</p>

<p>"And I tell thee a ruby could not be redder."</p>

<p>Yet with all the talk going on about them
of sheep and their distempers, men nevertheless
found opportunity to greet one another with the
secret signal which showed that they were members
of the Great Society.</p>

<p>"June the twelfth, then?"</p>

<p>"So long?"</p>

<p>"Plenty to do 'twixt now and then."</p>

<p>"Hush!"</p>

<p>"And I tell thee what to do with a sheep that dies."</p>

<p>"The whole country is to rise. There will not
remain one man at the plough&mdash;as I was saying,
soak the flesh well in water and keep it there from
daybreak till nones, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wot ye, whether the men of Hertforshire are
with us?"</p>

<p>"And keep it and drain it thoroughly and salt
it and dry it, and it will do for your laborers."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>
<p>"Ha, ha, ha!"</p>

<p>"Ho, ho, ho!"</p>

<p>"Yea, there be not one man who is not ready
to join in the march."</p>

<p>"And if there be one unready, we know an
argument or two that will bring him around."</p>

<p>"Here be Robert Annys and Jack the smith."</p>

<p>The greetings exchanged were hearty.</p>

<p>The men spoke cautiously among themselves,
every now and then interjecting some talk of
sheep into their conversation when one approached
who did not give the signal.</p>

<p>"I tell you, from Lincolnshire to Sussex the country
is like dry timber ready to ignite at a spark."</p>

<p>"Ay, come next Whitsunday, please God, the
lords will know who are the real masters."</p>

<p>"The land will not groan under so many sheriffs."</p>

<p>"And not so many lawyers will cumber the
ground."</p>

<p>"Ah, my men, have a care, have a care," broke
in Annys, "lest they do say with reason that
we are but ne'er-do-wells grasping for power. If
envy and greed are thought to be prodding us
on, our cause is as good as lost."</p>

<p>"Well, they have had their day long enough,"
grumbled the sturdy smith.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>
<p>Wat the cobbler, ever ready to make the peace,
now joined in. "Hast got big Ben and his men
to join us?" he asked of the smith.</p>

<p>"Well," was the answer, "I left him swaying
this way and that like a tree that yet needs the
last stroke to fall."</p>

<p>"Let us look to it, then, that the last stroke be
not put in by the other side," was the ready reply.</p>

<p>"Who will go to Kent and see that all is in
readiness for the march on the gaol? There
must be no half-hearted ones there."</p>

<p>"To go to Kent now is to clap one's head into
the Archbishop's noose," replied a Kentish man.
"Ball's boast that he would be set free by hundreds
of men marching from afar hath made even
the sheriffs look alive."</p>

<p>"I will go," said Annys, quietly.</p>

<p>"No russet priest may show his face near Canterbury."</p>

<p>"Then shall I go disguised as a minstrel, and
men shall know me by my songs."</p>

<p>"And get a broken pate for thy pains," said a
disgruntled minstrel, who well knew of what he
spoke.</p>

<p>"Oh, the cause must not suffer for want of a
broken pate or two," replied Annys, merrily.
But the truth was he really welcomed the opportunity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>with all his heart. He wanted work,
and work with the zest of danger in it was all
the better. He wanted some absorbing task,
some task that would claim his whole mind
and soul, that would shut out from him the
terrible struggle that he had been waging for
the past few days.</p>

<p>When he left the Fair with all the details
arranged to slip off secretly to Kent, he held his
head higher than he had done for many a day.
Now he was a man again, now he had cast off
that evil self, he was ready to sacrifice himself for
his fellow-men, ready to lay down his life for them
if need be. Work, work, work&mdash;that was man's
salvation from temptation; not physical torture
and isolation, but work that meant a flinging of
the whole being into some great interest, swallowing
up every thought unconnected with it. As
he walked rapidly along, that Robert Annys who
had permitted himself to become so harassed by
a passing lovesickness seemed like some other
man. Surely it could not have been he, Robert
Annys, Saviour of the Oppressed, Leader of the
Downtrodden People, Teacher of the Peasants,
Prophet of the New Era!</p>

<p>The Devil likes nothing better than a cock-sure
opponent.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>
<p>That moment, as he entered an unfrequented
lane, with his heart beating high with the exaltation
of his dangerous mission, with his whole
soul uplifted in the thought that he was holding
men's destinies in his hands, he saw Rose
sitting alone. His heart gave a great leap within
him, nevertheless he passed on, pretending not to
see her.</p>

<p>Rose grimaced. She sent a slipper after him,
hitting him full between the shoulders.</p>

<p>"Is that cousinly?" she cried, in her teasing
way. He paused, trembling, yet able to keep his
face turned from her.</p>

<p>"Cousin! Cousin! Cousin!" mocked the low
voice. He turned. He looked at her, and suddenly
a great wave arose within him and engulfed
the Great Uprising, the Secret Society, the Rescue,
the Gathering at Blackheath&mdash;all&mdash;all save
just one maid and she before him.</p>

<p>The hoarse voices of the men behind, the noises
of the Fair, smote upon him, yet nothing seemed
real save Rose, sitting there with a splendid, vivid
sense of life pulsating through her, the shadow of
her long lashes resting on her cheeks.</p>

<p>"Cousin indeed!" he said, with a sob in his
voice, "thou knowest well that can never be!"</p>

<p>He clasped both her hands in his.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>
<p>"I sought to flee thee," he said, with a strange
directness.</p>

<p>She smiled and tried to withdraw her hands.
But he would not relinquish them and held them
fast.</p>

<p>"But I will not flee thee now," he went on.
"I have done with struggling. It is useless."</p>

<p>"Nay," he added, with the superb assurance of
all lovers to whom eternity is but a passing
breath, "I shall never leave thee more."</p>

<p>Rose was not accustomed to analyze her feelings.
She acted first and thought afterward&mdash;if
at all, which was doubtful. But she was
puzzled at her conflicting emotions as she sat
there thrilling to the passion in his eyes. Her
whole body throbbed and trembled in unison with
his bounding pulses. She wanted to dismiss him
with a scolding for his faithlessness to dear little
Matilda. And she wanted to tell him that she
was in love with another. Surely all men save
the Baron were indifferent to her! Indeed, she
had been dreaming of de Leaufort just before this
impertinent poor priest had come and disturbed
her. She had closed her eyes and felt distinctly
the Baron's soft beard brush her cheeks; some
faint, elusive perfume that tantalized her memory
had entered into her senses; she had sunk into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>a delicious revery that almost approached a
swoon. She was in a dangerously emotional
mood. There is an early stage in the love affairs
of an emotional woman when she is in love, as has
before been said, not as she thinks, with a certain
man, but with the powerful emotions which he
can arouse. And, it may be added, at such a
stage to dream of her lover is not, as she fondly
believes, to harden herself against all other
comers, but on the contrary it is to break down
all the barriers before them. The wise rival is
he who knows how to seize upon the psychological
moment and urge his suit in no faint-hearted
manner. Later on there will come the time when
every line of the chosen one's countenance, every
trick of manner and speech, have entered into
the very warp and woof of her love. Then stand
off, it is too late! The image on the sensitive
plate of the heart is fixed, no longer is it a vague
shadow, easily blurred or superseded!</p>

<p>They said nothing. There was no need of
speech. Speech after all is needed only for those
poor mortals whose feet rest on the earth. There
is an eloquent, tumultuous speech of lovers which
is felt, not heard. Their palms beat wildly one
into the other, their lips grew dry, they drew
long, deep, quivering breaths.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>
<p>Then, when he kissed her full red lips,&mdash;the
first time he had kissed a woman's lips,&mdash;it came
over him that this exquisite creature was no companion
for a poor russet priest.</p>

<p>He raised her hand to his lips. "How came
you to love a poor priest!" he exclaimed, wondering.</p>

<p>"I love the Bishop in you," she answered,
laughing.</p>

<p>"Ah, 'tis a long way from an excommunicated
poor priest to a Bishop."</p>

<p>"Nay," she pouted, "I shall have a palace."</p>

<p>He thought her beauty worthy of a king, and
told her so.</p>

<p>"Then make me a queen!" she cried impudently.
"Yea, a great lady, a great prelate's lady.
I can adorn a palace, think you, then a palace, a
palace give me!"</p>

<p>He tried to take her in fun: "Ay, a palace, a
palace. They grow in the fields&mdash;pick me one!"</p>

<p>"Laugh not, I mean a real palace of stone.
Look not so dazed. Was not the Archdeaconate
of Ely offered you? You shall yet have a
Bishopric."</p>

<p>"But that was long ago!"</p>

<p>"Humph! 'long ago,' and will not the Church
be gladder than ever to take back the poor priest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>who can hold so many men from the Uprising?"</p>

<p>What was all this? It was madness. He had
given himself to the people, he could never recant.</p>

<p>She kissed his hands.</p>

<p>"These fingers will yet hold a Bishop's staff,"
she said. Her beauty was maddening. He would
not think of the future. He gave himself up to
the present. The breath from her lips shook
him to the very core of his being. He rained
kisses on her passionately&mdash;on hair, cheeks, eyes,
and lips; and for all that there was a certain
fierceness in his caresses, she was unafraid and
well content to have it so.</p>

<p>Suddenly a jeering laugh rang through the
air:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, Sir Russet-priest, so this is the way
you follow the call of your dear Master, Jesus
Christ! 'Wheresoever my Master calls me,' I
think you said to me. Ho, ho, odsooks! did the
good Lord graciously call me into so fair a place,
I doubt not I should go even as willingly." The
two sprang apart and saw the evil face of Hugo
Stott leering at them. Rose was frankly frightened
and turned again and clung to Annys, whose
first impulse was such as any man would feel, to
strike the impudent fellow to the ground. But an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>uncomfortable trick had grown upon him of recalling
certain bits of the Gospel at all moments
of excitement, and the particular lines that now
rang through his brain had in them an appositeness
that staid his hand:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"If thou give fully to thy soul the delight of her desire, she
will make thee the laughing-stock of thine enemies."</p></div>

<p>Indeed, it had come. Already he was the
laughing-stock of his enemy. He was degraded
before the very scum of the earth. He had
brought the name of his beloved Lord on the
lips of a sneering pardon-seller. He was held up,
a self-convicted hypocrite, before the very prince
of hypocrites. What could he say for himself?
What could he plead? Nothing, save that he
was in the grasp of the same terrible power that
had brought ruin to hundreds before him. Ah!
but stay, he had done wrong, great wrong; he
had sinned grievously, yet by some miraculous
interposition of the Lord he had been drawn
back from the last step that would have cast him
into the pit of hell. He had been saved. And
by what a hand! Yet, although it had pleased
Heaven to send a strange instrument of salvation,
nevertheless, he must render due thanks to his
deliverer. So, to Stott's utter surprise, instead of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>felling him to the earth, Annys flung off the girl
and extended his hand humbly to him.</p>

<p>"Thanks," he said contritely. "Thou hast
snatched me from the jaws of hell."</p>

<p>Stott could scarce believe his eyes, for he was
but too ready to believe that Robert Annys was
as the usual run of the priests he encountered,
ever ready to preach, but not so ready to practise.</p>

<p>In the sudden religious exaltation that swept
over him Annys was totally unconscious of his
cruelty toward the woman whom he had just
clasped in his arms. He could think only of his
own wonderful escape. Rose rested on the ground
as she had been flung, half reclining, half kneeling,
dazed at the sudden change that had come
over the ardent lover of a minute before. The
uppermost thought in her mind was how handsome
he looked in his new-found indignation.
His eyes, at other times the pale blue eyes of a
dreamer, now scintillated as the dark blue night
sky, when the air is crisp and clear and thrilling
with the glory of the stars. Deep down within
her lay a discontent that all his passion for her
had awakened in his eyes no such splendor. She
longed to be able to awaken that light in his eyes
purely for herself alone; she was fascinated by
the peculiar change it wrought in his face; she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>found a certain pleasure in watching him impersonally,
quite as if the object of his indignation
were some one else and not herself at all.</p>

<p>As he drew himself up and looked down upon
the girl, her beauty seemed to him surely of the
Evil One. There rushed over him a horror that
he could have succumbed so easily to the temptation
that befalls every anchorite. What? was it
possible that he, Robert Annys, had been ready
but an instant ago to deny his people, to draw
them from their most sacred cause, ready to desert
the great-hearted leader to whom he had
sworn lealty, all for this woman before him?
Could one fall lower than this? He had been
all too willing to trail the fair robes of the Holy
Spouse in the dust to keep this creature by his
side. He had listened to her pleadings to make
himself a great prelate solely that he might twine
golden chains in her locks; he to set yet another
example before the people of rapacity and sensuality
within the Church, and thereby discourage
by so much every honest reformer! God! what
wonder that he took it all as a manifestation of
the powers of the Evil One? If a mage had
appeared unto him and showed him a magnet
which drew to it all the trees of the forest, one by
one, until they all lay upturned and useless, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>great gaping wounds in the earth, where, but a
moment before, they had risen proudly, would he
not have declared him a sorcerer, and taken him
to some holy man to have him purged of his
devil? or had him burned publicly at the stake?
And what else but some evil sorcery could draw
a man from the place where he had been rooted
deep down, could sever his heart at a blow from
all the things that he held sacred, and could leave
him prostrate and useless, a cause of stumbling
to the wayfarer?</p>

<p>He had been saved at the eleventh hour by
divine interposition. His soul quivered with joy
at again being accepted of the Lord. He raised
his crucifix high over the crouching figure of the
girl, and, after crossing himself on the breast and
shoulders, he launched forth the terrible words of
exorcism:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Satan, enemy of the Faith, enemy of the
human race, who brought Death into the world,
who has rebelled against all justice, seducer of
man, root of all evil, promoter of all vices, come
out, come out, I command you, from the body
of this woman. Come forth, come forth, I command
you, in the name of the Father, the Son,
and the Holy Ghost."</p>

<p>At last Rose awoke to the situation. Her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>amused incredulity of the whole strange scene
now gave way to a furious anger that he could
dare so to humiliate her. That comes of permitting
a priest to make love to you&mdash;you never
know when the saint will conquer the mere man.
And there he stood in such immaculateness, his
robes gathered about him, his form drawn up as
if there were contamination in her very touch.
There he stood, clasping that crucifix as if the
Lord on it were his own special protector. Why
didn't he go and have done with it? If he was
remorseful, so was she; she never wanted to see
his sanctimonious face again. And there was
that horrid knob-nosed pardoner looking on!
How dared he! how dared he! She would reply
to him, she would shame him for his cowardice,
she would&mdash;What she did do was to throw herself
face downward on the ground, shedding tears
of exasperation and impotent rage. Annys, taking
this, very naturally, for a sign of penitence,
thought that his exorcism had had effect, and
strode off well satisfied, leaving the pardoner to
gloat over the beauty of the girl with whom he so
strangely and unexpectedly found himself alone.
For an instant he watched the departing figure
of the young priest with jaw dropped in astonishment.
Could it all have been a magnificent piece
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>of acting? No, it was impossible; even to such
a cynic as Hugo Stott, it was evident that the
man had been thoroughly in earnest. He looked
at the girl and his eyes glistened. He tiptoed
up to her.</p>

<p>"The devil or no devil, 'tis a delicate morsel.
I fear not the devil, nor anything else when 'tis
so well disguised."</p>

<p>He would have liked to bury his ugly face in
her white neck, but, even as he approached her,
she turned suddenly and screamed so loud that
instantly a number of men rushed from the fair
grounds. They could only swear roundly at the
disappearing figure of the pardoner, who had lost
no time in making off as quickly as his long gown
and clumsy form would permit.</p>

<p>The sight of Rose, pale and trembling, and the
obvious inference of what might have happened
had they been less prompt, did not tend to make
them waste any love on monks and pardoners.
Little enough love wasted already!</p>

<h2>XX</h2>


<p>Annys no longer had the strength to continue
on his journey into Kent. That night he spent in
alternately praying upon his knees and pacing up
and down in anguish of spirit. Although a child
of Mediævalism, and more or less heir to the
Mediæval ideas and superstitions, yet there was
much within him that was in advance of his age.
He could not take comfort in the current conception
of the nature of woman. His dearly cherished
views on the marriage of the clergy, his profound
hope that the love of woman would be lifted
from the base, animal view that obtained in the
morbid fancy of the followers of Mani,&mdash;all went
to arouse within him a trust and belief in womanhood
which chafed at his contemptible action in
throwing all the blame upon Rose. Often in the
past had he been overwhelmed with shame as he
read the cynical confessions of priest after priest
and saint after saint, wherein all the weakness of
the man had been laid on the ofttimes innocent
shoulders of the woman. He always had had a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>contempt for the horrible selfishness that could
permit a saint to sin with a woman, and then in a
fit of repentance mount to heaven with beatific
grace while at the same instant with perfect equanimity
he sees the woman sink into the awaiting
fires of hell.</p>

<p>And then there came swiftly upon him the
recollection that the practical outcome of his sudden
pious exaltation had been to leave a beautiful
and helpless girl at the mercy of an unscrupulous
man like Stott. In that thought lay a strong
agony that was not entirely spiritual. Enraged
both at himself and the pardoner, he would gladly
have strangled the fellow, had he but come upon
him at that instant.</p>

<p>The slow-footed dawn came and found him
worn and discouraged. He was utterly unfit to
go upon his mission to Kent. The joy of helping
others should be vouchsafed only to such as
first can help themselves. He, forsooth, a leader
of other men! No longer could he lead himself.
He was but a broken reed. The calm shelter of
the Abbey appealed to him with renewed insistence.
He could close his eyes and instantly the
chapel with its dim religious light was before him.
He could see the dark, cowled figures of the
monks passing in noiselessly, he could see their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>bowed heads as they devoutly worshipped. The
beautiful chanted responses, the sombre throb of
the organ, shook him to the very soul.</p>

<p>So he went to Matilda and told her that he was
about to ask to be taken back into the Church,
in order to have a brief respite in a holy retreat.</p>

<p>"I have chosen to go, not to St. Edmund's, but
St. Dunstan's, ten miles on.</p>

<p>"I am all at sea," he added pathetically, "adrift
and helpless. Perhaps I have been too stiff-necked.
Perhaps God hath punished me for
concerning myself too much with things temporal.
Perhaps after all the Church is right in
that the mission on earth of the priestly office is
not to make earth a better abiding-place, but so
to lift up the minds of men, so to fill their hearts
with thoughts of the life hereafter, that the ills of
this life sink into utter insignificance."</p>

<p>Some of his old-time arguments against that
false conception of Christianity rose to her lips
in reply. The very words that he had spoken to
her again and again she longed to speak, and yet
a certain pride held her silent. She could not
bear to have him think she was pleading for herself.
Of course he could not marry her if he
entered again into the Church, and yet she would
not have been human had there been no comfort
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>in the thought that neither could he marry any
other woman. For, with the quick intuition of a
woman who loves, she had read the secret that
was torturing him. There had been moments
when she had been tempted to give him his freedom
and permit him to wed her cousin. But she
read his heart too profoundly to believe that
he could ever look on Rose as a poor priest's
wife. He was wrestling with the Evil One, and
it was her part only to pray for him, which she
did with all the strength and fervor of her pure
soul.</p>

<p>He looked down on her, and he thought his
heart would break within him as he realized how
strongly he yearned, really yearned, to love this
dear, sweet woman, and how utterly impossible it
was for her frank, pure eyes to quicken one beat
of his pulse. For he had learned something, and
he knew now that men did not love merely with
their minds and souls. He knew now that, save
he loved with every drop in his veins and every
nerve in his body, it was not what men called
love. He took her firm, strong hand in his, and
readily would he have cut his own from his arm
could he have felt shoot through him the exquisite
bounding of the pulses that would come even from
the faintest touch of Rose's hand. What was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>this marvellous emotion that comes not and goes
not as a man wills it?</p>

<p>He saw with a tightening of his heart-strings
that Matilda looked wan, as if she, too, had lost
much sleep. Yes, she was very dear to him, and
to see her unhappy distressed him keenly. To
bid farewell to her was like bidding farewell to a
part of himself, so fully had she entered into his
life. Yet he, himself, had paled those cheeks and
drawn those new, strange lines about her mouth.
Had another man done this, gladly would he have
beaten him within an inch of his life. Ah, how
had he justified the noble trust which that great-hearted
lad had given him? How could he ever
look Richard Meryl in the face again? O that
he had never entered into their lives, or at least
not until they had been united. What a friend,
what a sister, he had lost! A low moan broke
from him and a shudder that seemed to break his
frame in two.</p>

<p>She forgot her wrongs, and pitied him. "God
speed thee, and bring thee back stronger than
ever for the needed work."</p>

<p>"Ay, pray for me!" he said, "I need thy prayers
sorely."</p>

<p>As he walked along the woods, and drew nearer
to the Abbey, he grew more at peace with himself.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>Already the touch of the holy life was upon his
soul. He scarce noticed what was about him,
so distinct was the picture of the Abbey walls
before him. Suddenly he observed a bit of bright
color. Was it some fancy of his tortured brain,
or was it really Rose seated there at the foot of a
tree?</p>

<p>She was in a mood that was complicated, even
for her. After the scene with Annys on the outskirts
of the Fair, she had encountered the Baron.
Stung with anger and resentment against the poor
priest who had so shamed her, and also struggling
against a remorseful contrition at having countenanced
(and more than countenanced) the love-making
of Matilda's plighted lover, she welcomed
the distraction of the Baron's ardent wooing. She
loathed her life and her surroundings. He painted
the future in roseate colors. So, even as Annys
approached, she was on the point of keeping a
rendezvous with the Baron, who was to carry her
off with him to the castle&mdash;that great, glorious,
gloomy, dread, yet fascinating castle. And yet,
although her mind was fully made up, she played
with an idea, as was her wont, deep down in a kind
of subconscious fashion. Suppose, after all, she
had fled with Annys! How his eyes had blazed!
And those sensitive lips! One was tantalized into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>wondering whether there trembled on them a kiss
or an Ave!</p>

<p>After all, there would have been a certain subtle
charm in being the mistress of a great and stately
prelate that would be totally lacking in giving herself
to one so frankly of this world as the Baron
de Leaufort. Her prelate-lover might come to
her straight from the preaching of a sermon on
chastity; she would kiss away all recollection of it.
She could see others approach him as their spiritual
adviser, and watch the holy purity of his face
and revel in the knowledge that at will she could
sweep over it the swift pallor of desire. She was
full of all sorts of whimsical pictures as she looked
up suddenly and saw Annys gazing fiercely, hungrily,
down at her.</p>

<p>"You are ill," she cried, startled.</p>

<p>"Ill?" he answered, in a strange, hard voice,
strange even to his own ears. "Ill! Ay! ill unto
death, and all the saints in heaven cannot save
me."</p>

<p>He buried his face in his hands for an instant,
and then he looked at her and a groan escaped
him.</p>

<p>"Woman," he said, "in my foolishness I thought
that love could come of heaven."</p>

<p>She spoke no word, but watched him, fascinated.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>
<p>"Ay, poor, ignorant fool that I was! But now
do I wot right well that it cometh not out of
heaven, but of hell, woman, of hell, of hell!</p>

<p>"See!" he cried, grasping her suddenly by the
shoulders so that she winced with pain. "See, I
have sought to flee thee, I have sought to escape
by every means in my power. Even now am I on
my way to shut out the sight of thee in a cell at St.
Dunstan's. I have prayed, and I have scourged
and chastised myself&mdash;but all in vain, still it conquers
me, it tortures me, this terrible power that
from time immemorial hath been the snare and
curse of man&mdash;the carnal love of woman."</p>

<p>He noticed that his grasp hurt her, but he did
not care.</p>

<p>"I held myself," he continued, "even I, above
the Holy Fathers, above the Saints, above temptation.
I thought it might be given to man to love
tenderly and chastely. <em>Tenderly! O my God!
tenderly!</em> Listen. I love thee, but there is nothing
whatever of tenderness in my love, for I warn
thee it hath turned me into a foul demon. Flee
me, flee me while there is yet time, flee me, for
there is naught of Christ's tender, beautiful love
in this. Nay, I tell thee the Fathers were right, the
love of man for woman is a cursed, cursed thing."</p>

<p>And making the sign of the cross, he sank
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>upon the ground, face down, that he could no
longer look upon her.</p>

<p>There was something in his helplessness as he
lay there, that appealed to her better side, to that
elemental mother-nature that lies somewhere, however
deep down, in the worst woman. The swift
thought to revenge herself for his humiliation of
her, to keep him by her until the arrival of the
Baron and then to hold him up to ridicule and
scorn&mdash;was put aside as quickly as it was conceived.
She would slip away noiselessly and let
him forget her if he could. She would even pray
that he might be able to. He looked so utterly
worn and ill that her tenderness went a bit too
far. With a sudden impulsive movement she bent
low and laid one hand lightly upon one hollow
temple. In an instant he sprang up wildly,
fiercely, but she had slipped quickly behind the
broad trunk of an old oak and he gazed about him
stupidly. Had it all been but a wild fantasy of
his overstrained brain? He had sprung up determined
to clasp her in his arms. His struggle
was at an end, he could fight no longer.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"For this was I crucified? Thou hast crucified me again."</p></div>

<p>The plaintive words rose and fell soft and sweet
through the woods.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>
<p>The figure of the Lord stood before him, and
oh, how infinitely sad was the beloved countenance.
Annys threw himself before Him, shaken
by terrible sobs. The figure faded away. The
woods were full of the cries of demons, evil faces
mocked and jeered at him from the branches of
the trees. The sky grew copper-hued. He fled
as swiftly as his trembling limbs would carry him.</p>

<p>His one thought was to reach the Abbey. Already
he longed to feel the sting of the lash about
his shoulders.</p>

<h2>XXI</h2>


<p>It had been noticed for some time past by all
members of the household that the Abbot of St.
Dunstan seemed ill at ease. It was even the cause
of some jesting among the monks that, for the first
time in the recollection of his brothers, the Abbot's
appetite had failed.</p>

<p>And small wonder that the usually placid Abbot
was disturbed at heart, for there had been rumors
in the air of an intended visit from the Bishop to
inquire into certain scandals that for some time
past had noisily rung in his ears, in spite of their
unwillingness to hear them. At last, but two days
ago, a letter had been sent by messenger from the
Bishop, announcing that he had been compelled
to write, instead of coming in person, because,
although his spirit was unfailing, his flesh was
all too weak to stand the great burden of his
calling. The scathing denunciations in the letter
proved indeed that the prelate's "spirit was
unfailing," but, severe as they were, the Abbot
thanked his stars that at least he had escaped
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>a visit. Before dictating a proper answer to the
pastoral letter, an answer that should breathe a
spirit of the most complete contrition and humility,
once more the abbot read it from beginning
to end:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="hangingindent">"<em>Thomas, by divine compassion, Bishop of Ely, for Christ's
sake&mdash;Greeting to John Wallingham, Abbot of the Abbey
of St. Dunstan.</em></p>

<p>"Since we, although unworthy, are by the requirements of our
office bound to render account of you and all our people before
the eternal Judge 'terrible among kings of the earth,' we, therefore,
are moved inwardly by grief of heart and pained even to
the very marrow of our soul that evils so base, so loathsome, so
shameful, so diabolical, so infamous, and so impious, separate
you from the body of Christ and join you to the body of our
ancient adversary. For the name of Christ is blasphemed by
you, and the Holy Scriptures through you who by the mouth
of your detestably vile body presume to teach and guide others.</p>

<p>"Now, though absent in body, yet present in spirit, we attempt
in writing what we cannot at present accomplish by word of
mouth. We admonish you that you take heed to receive this
writing of ours as though it were the word of the Lord Himself
with awe and humility of mind.</p>

<p>"Therefore we beseech you and command you: let the remembrance
of your profession come to you; bring often before
your eyes the sacred order to which you belong, to which is
joined the vow of chastity; consider also the guidance of souls
which you have undertaken, in which should be shown the
example of chastity. In addition to these things, ponder, I
specially entreat, over the fear of hell, and the love of celestial
pleasures. Occupy yourself, I beseech you, by the crucifixion
of Christ, for the future, with the importance of a holy conduct
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>of life, cleanse yourself of the stain of crime, and by the radiance
of good deeds flee the darkness of your past life, and by
the fragrance of a good reputation dispel the repulsive odors
which have arisen.</p>

<p>"And so, with the tenderness of my inmost soul, I ask that
you drink the bitter portion of this page, inasmuch as it is
offered lovingly and that through it you may profit and benefit.
Drink, therefore, not only willingly, but eagerly, the bitter cup
of your transformation into a new man.</p>

<p class="right">
"Farewell in Christ, Farewell."<br />
</p></div>

<p class="mt2">What could the Abbot write in reply, to convince
the Bishop that a visit in person was not
necessary? There was a strong probability that
a smooth, repentant letter might deceive the old
man; but once let his penetrating eyes fall on the
Abbot himself, let him come near enough to hear
the thousand and one bits of scandal that were
floating about the neighborhood, and the Abbot's
occupancy of the monastery was but a question
of hours. Besides, the Abbot needed time to set
in motion an earnest appeal to the Archbishop to
relieve him of the "inquisitorial jurisdiction of the
Bishop of Ely." And if that did not succeed,
there still would be Rome to appeal to. Plenty
of Abbeys had received this privilege, and the
Abbey of St. Dunstan had grown rich and had
more moneys to spend than even the powerful
Bishop, who had his great estate to keep up and
who could not mortgage his properties beyond
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>his own lifetime. The monastery of St. Dunstan
had indeed thrived off the popularity of its
shrine to St. Mary, to which women came who
were desirous of becoming mothers. The divine
afflatus had worked so many miracles upon wives
who had long disappointed the hopes of their husbands,
that its reputation had spread throughout
the land. For a while vast content filled the
breasts of the fortunate fathers, but little by little
certain ugly rumors began to be whispered, and it
was these that caused the Bishop's letter.</p>

<p>The patient scribe awaited the Abbot's pleasure.
The Abbot fumed and scowled. At last,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Most dearly beloved Brother in Christ," he
began.</p>

<p>Just then a monk stood before him. "What
do you want?" asked the Abbot, somewhat impatiently,
since he was at last launched upon the
important letter, and it would not do to put off
answering it too long, or the writer might suddenly
find strength to come in person. "What is it?"</p>

<p>"There stands before the gate a russet priest
who begs admission," spoke up the monk.</p>

<p>"Admit him. Why come you to me for that?
I am occupied. Begone!"</p>

<p>"But, most revered Father, by his own admission
he is under the ban of the Church."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>
<p>"Ah, so? Let me see him." And the Abbot
slowly waddled to the gate, and peered through
the bars. There he saw a young poor priest
upon his knees.</p>

<p>"What do you wish?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I wish to be received again into the bosom of
the Church."</p>

<p>"Do you wish it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I wish and desire it."</p>

<p>"Your name?"</p>

<p>"Robert Annys."</p>

<p>The Abbot's eyes lit up with triumph. He
knew well the story of this wilful young poor
priest, who had refused high office at the hand
of the Hierarchy and defied it. Perchance if he
converted this notorious sinner, the Bishop might
be brought to look less severely on his own past
sins. The Abbot looked down upon the young
man complacently. "The fellow looks meek
enough now," he thought. He drew himself up,
and spoke in solemn tones the words that would
receive the erring one back into the bosom of the
Church. Pleasanter work this, by far, and more
soothing to his pride, than penning letters of contrition
and obeisance.</p>

<p>"Receive, then," he recited, "the sign of the
Cross of Jesus Christ and of Christianity, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>you have hitherto borne and which the error
which had deceived you caused you to lose most
miserably."</p>

<p>Then he swung wide the ponderous gate, saying:</p>

<p>"Enter into the house of God, after having
departed therefrom, bewildered unhappily by error.
Know you that you have been snatched from the
snares which are Death and Destruction."</p>

<p>Annys followed the Abbot to his private chamber.
The Abbot knew well the type of man
before him, the exalted, morbidly self-censorious
type, which would fling itself on the cold, hard
ground for an entire night for the harboring of
an unholy thought. He listened with benignant
countenance to the tale of the penitent man, and
well he believed his word that this had been his
first temptation to sin. He knew, too, that this
was a case that required soothing rather than
harassing. This was the kind of man whose reason
becomes unseated from a real agony of contrition.
He laid one fat hand upon the shoulder
of the young poor priest who kneeled before him,
abjectly.</p>

<p>"How do you know, my son, that it was a
woman whom you encountered in the woods on
your way here, and who tempted you so sorely?"</p>

<p>How did he know? How could he bring himself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>to say that every nerve in his body had
trembled with ecstasy in her presence?</p>

<p>"Yea, it was a woman, Holy Father, the most
beautiful woman on the earth."</p>

<p>The Abbot smiled; in the course of a long
experience he had heard of a good many most
beautiful women on the earth.</p>

<p>"I know well that it bore the semblance of a
woman," he went on suavely, "but how know you
that it was other than an evil spirit&mdash;one of
Satan's minions sent to tempt you on your way
to Holy Church?"</p>

<p>Was it possible? Was the whole thing but a
horrible vision which had been sent to mock him?
Horrible! Was it, then, wholly horrible? Great
God! he was undone indeed. Here he kneeled
at the foot of his confessor, and, instead of the
countenance of his dear Lord, the tantalizing,
brilliant beauty of a woman's face was before his
eyes. He was utterly lost in sin.</p>

<p>"O Father, most Holy Father," he cried passionately,
"shrive me, shrive me! I will fast three
days, not even water shall pass my lips. I will
spend three whole nights on my bare knees on
the ground. I will bear three thousand lashes,
anything, anything. Only let the countenance
of my God be turned again toward me."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>
<p>"Tell me, did not the form of the woman seem
to disappear miraculously when you made the sign
of the cross?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, Holy Father; the ground seemed to
part and swallow her up, and she disappeared
from my sight utterly."</p>

<p>"Ah, I thought as much. Doubtless she descended
into the awaiting pit of hell. I shall
exorcise the Evil Spirit from you, and you shall
have peace. Fear not. All will yet be well."</p>

<p>"A penance, a penance."</p>

<p>The Abbot pondered for a moment. He must
name something that would appeal to the penitent
as sufficient, yet he dared not permit him to
undergo too severe a strain in his evidently exhausted
condition. Suddenly his face lit up with
an inspiration. "I have heard," he said, "of your
good work among the poor. The rustics believe
in you and trust you. Go to the cellarer and get
bread in plenty and scatter it in great largesse
among the poor people" (he could yet make the
monastery bear a sweeter name before the coming
of the Bishop) "and give it all in the name of the
Abbey of St. Dunstan, forgetting not to deliver
with it the blessing of the Holy Abbot."</p>

<p>But Annys implored that some real penance
be given him. "Besides," he added, "I have no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>longer the strength to go forth into the world.
There will I meet with women. I desire and
pray not to see the face of woman more."</p>

<p>The Abbot hid a smile. He had heard like
protestations before. He had also known to come
later the fervent appeals for permission to depart
from the Abbey for a brief space. With the giving
of such permissions the Abbot was notoriously
generous.</p>

<p>"Well," returned the Abbot, "wait, and for the
present remain here and spend the night on your
knees on the floor saying four hundred Aves, and
in the morning, before your fast is broken, one
hundred lashes shall be laid across your back."</p>

<p>"One thousand, Holy Father."</p>

<p>"I have spoken."</p>

<p>Then the Abbot motioned Annys to follow
him, and proceeded to the chapel, where they
discovered all the members of the monastery
assembled. At the entrance, Annys took the
oath of fidelity and then prostrated himself while
the monks chanted in unison the seven Penitential
Psalms.</p>

<p>It would have taken a brazen sinner indeed to
remain unmoved during the touching service of
receiving the excommunicated one back again
into the fold. Annys was deeply stirred. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>lay on the floor of the chapel, shaken by long-drawn
sobs, while the exquisite modulations of
the solemn chant rose and fell about him. In
the dim religious light, the monks in their flowing
robes, their pallid faces standing out like
carved ivory against their black cowls, seemed as
spectres from another world looking on the trial
of a soul before the Great Judge.</p>

<p>How sure, how unfaltering, was the touch of
Holy Church upon the penitent soul. With what
fine intuition did the service bring to the soul of
the evil-doer the sense of sin, and finally through
the whole gamut of human emotions,&mdash;terror,
faltering hope, faith, despair,&mdash;at last, through
humiliation and renunciation, lift it with rapture
to God.</p>

<p>At first the terror of the Lord's wrath is upon
him:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">"O Lord, rebuke me not in thine anger,</div>
      <div class="verse">Neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.</div>
      <div class="verse">Have mercy upon me, O Lord; for I am withered away."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Then a calmer note is struck, one of confession:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">"I acknowledged my sin unto thee,</div>
      <div class="verse">And mine iniquity have I not hid."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>


<p>Then the ardent supplication, vibrating with a
passionate contrition:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Then creeps in the note of despair:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">"Hide not thy face from me in the day of my distress.</div>

      <div class="verse">For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with weeping."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Once more the calmness of renunciation and
humility:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">"Teach me to do thy will:</div>
      <div class="verse">For thou art my God."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>


<p>At last bursting forth into the glorious anthem
of deliverance:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">"Blessed be the Lord my rock.</div>

      <div class="verse">Upon a psaltery of ten strings will I sing praises unto thee."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>As the last triumphant words of the refrain
slowly died away, Annys was conducted to the
altar, where he again prostrated himself, while
the Abbot offered up a special prayer for his
salvation and made the sign of the cross over
him. No longer was he under the ban of the
Church. He rested on her bosom as a wearied
child spent with sobs.</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>



<h2>XXII</h2>


<p>But the peace that Annys had so fondly hoped
for in the monastery was farther away from him
than ever. The week that followed was a daily,
hourly struggle with the devil within him. With
a body scarce kept alive by the scant portion of
food which he permitted himself but once a day,
in the hopes of conquering the awful sway of the
senses, in reality he was innocently making their
hold the stronger upon him.</p>

<p>In his wild passion for repentance his once
clear vision of the follies of Manichæism left him,
and he plunged into the false notion of the monastic
world that passions can be killed by killing
the body. The faintness caused by lack of food,
the cramps in his limbs from constant kneeling,
made him unable to sleep. Instead, the nights
passed in a kind of waking semi-consciousness,
filled with horrible dreams of beautiful women
alluringly holding out their arms to him, and
then, as he was about to clasp them, changing
into dreadful fiends, grinning and spitting fire at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>him. Or else he thought that women were pressing
kisses upon his lips, and faint from the
strength of his emotions, his weak body could
endure no more. Enraged by the torments, he
sought to escape them by castigating himself
afresh. As others had done before him, so he
tried to forget the existence of his body by making
himself exquisitely conscious of every aching,
throbbing inch of it.</p>

<p>The methods of monasticism were a failure in
subduing the carnal nature of man. Few monks
were like St. P&oelig;men, who, when accused of thinking
too much of his body, defended his right to
wash his feet by declaring that he had learned to
kill, not his body, but his passions.</p>

<p>The normal man, when the pangs of hunger
assail him, eats his meal and straightway forgets
all about the existence of his stomach. For a
brief space&mdash;at least until the next meal is due&mdash;he
may concern himself with ideals. The normal
man sleeps his eight hours or so, and therefore
the need for sleep does not overshadow the
hours that he chooses to devote to the work of
the Lord. The ascetic who spends his day with
back bent and knees pressing the hard ground of
a cell, who tries to limit his sleep to four hours
and that upon a bare board, and whose diet consists
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>of dry bread and muddy water, is on the fair
road to be conquered by that which he fondly
thinks he is conquering.</p>

<p>On the seventh night, while his staring, burning
eyes looked into the darkness, Annys suddenly
became aware of a light of peculiar softness and
purity, which appearing particularly bright at a
certain spot opposite, filled the entire cell with
its beautiful radiance.</p>

<p>He raised himself partially from the board on
which he lay, and watched curiously the spot
where the light shone brightest. It was not long
before he made out the lines of a man robed in
the impressive vestments of a Pope, the superb
jewelled tiara upon his head.</p>

<p>There was something in the dark, glittering
eyes, the haughty mien, the compelling magnetism
of the figure that in some mysterious manner
made him certain that Gregory the Seventh,
the great, indomitable Hildebrand, stood before
him.</p>

<p>"Art thou one Robert Annys, poor priest, who
departed from Holy Church and went about
among the poor stirring up sedition and insurrection?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"Nay, Most Holy Father, I am that one Robert
Annys who went about from village to village
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>teaching of 'Christ and him crucified.' If I sinned,
I sinned only in following too closely the example
of Christ, which is the one unpardonable sin of the
Church Hierarchical."</p>

<p>The Pope's face darkened, and then a slight
smile crept into it. "Hot-headed, and fearless
e'en as they told me," he exclaimed. Then he
regarded him severely. "Blaspheme not! Art
thou he who would boldly proclaim that the
marriage of the clergy is not an unholy thing?"</p>

<p>Annys groaned for answer, "Ay, I am he."</p>

<p>"Look, Robert Annys, then, I cannot find it in
my heart to cast thee wholly from Grace, and I
may yet intercede for thee, because thou art such
as err through too great enthusiasm. Tell me
concerning these ideas of marriage. Let me hear
all from thee, that I misjudge thee not."</p>

<p>"Most Holy Father, I thought that religion
should lie in every act of man and not alone in
breviaries and masses. I sought to create a priesthood
that would understand the people and enter
into their lives and needs. And we shall never
have that, O Holy Father, until the priests share
the people's joys and sorrows. The heart of the
priest must beat at the same sight that thrills the
heart of the peasant; the smiles of the priest must
spring from the same source that gladdens the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>humblest breast; the tears of the priest must flow
from the same anguish that wrings the heart of
the lowliest one."</p>

<p>The haughty prelate listened patiently while
the young poor priest spoke.</p>

<p>"Ah, my son," he said at last, seeing him pause,
"such a vision takes a high hope of Man and a
firm belief in his purity of heart. I fear thy
faith would not be justified. It takes account of
the priest lifting up the average man, but it takes
none whatever of the average man drawing down
the priest."</p>

<p>Annys opened his lips to speak, but Hildebrand
waved one hand to command silence and continued:
"Now, my son, in the course of thy wanderings,
doubtless thou didst encounter women such as
thou hast been fond of describing, who would,
through their great purity and perfect sympathy
and unselfishness, make the ideal spouse for
the priest. Tell me of such women, do they
exist?"</p>

<p>"They exist," cried Annys, vehemently, and
then his voice failed him. He could not bring
himself to speak of Matilda.</p>

<p>The eyes of the Pope blazed. "Ha! I thought
as much," he murmured.</p>

<p>Then at last, reluctantly, Annys brought himself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>to speak of Matilda, her simple charity, her
ready self-sacrifice, her tender sympathy and
unfailing helpfulness.</p>

<p>"And of course, were Rome to give thee permission
to take a wife, it would be this same gentle,
helpful, ideal spouse thou wouldst choose?"</p>

<p>Hildebrand watched the face of Annys keenly.</p>

<p>But Annys covered his face with his hands.</p>

<p>A bitter smile crossed the Pope's face. "How?
could it be that one could hesitate before all this
perfection?"</p>

<p>"Ah, torture me no longer," burst out Annys.
"I will confess all."</p>

<p>"No need," answered the Pope, coldly. "I
know all. I have followed thy career with a great
compassion in my heart. Dost still think that
did the Church permit the marriage of the priests,
they would all take unto themselves Matildas?
Ah, Robert Annys, see how utterly thou didst
fall from Grace! I tell thee, thy religion would
be one only for saints, but the Holy Catholic
Church takes cognizance of the weak and
sinful."</p>

<p>Annys strove to reply, but his voice failed him.
Then it seemed to him that the figure of the Pope
disappeared with a loud noise, and there came the
sound of heavy blows upon the door of his cell;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>he tried to rise and go to the door, but he fell back
unconscious.</p>

<p>When he opened his eyes, it was to look into
the gentle face of the Bishop of Ely bending
solicitously over him.</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>



<h2>XXIII</h2>


<p>It was indeed the Bishop of Ely who had
ordered the door of the cell broken down, and had
rescued Annys from what would doubtless have
been his last fainting spell. He had succeeded so
well in subduing his flesh that at last it was on
the point of separating itself entirely from the
spirit. The Bishop brought him to with difficulty,
and sent him to the infirmary to be nursed
back to strength. He did not return to Ely until
he saw the tinge of health returning slowly to
the young priest's sunken cheeks.</p>

<p>Thomas of Ely had conquered his own weakness
of flesh after all, and had taken the journey
to the Abbey of St. Dunstan before the wily
Abbot had time to receive his answer from the
Archbishop. He had dealt summarily with Abbot
John and deposed him, refusing to listen to his
plea for mercy; for nothing outraged the Bishop
so keenly as that a servant of Holy Church should
betray his sacred trust. He would have liked to
appoint Robert Annys as the Abbot's successor;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>but as that was utterly impossible for the present,
he appointed a most worthy monk who was the
unanimous choice of his brethren.</p>

<p>Little by little Robert's strength returned, and
his kind adviser led him gently back to the thought
that he could again be of use to others. Therein,
the Bishop knew, lay the only balm to the tortured
heart. He gave a hint to the new Abbot,
who gave Annys work to do in the scriptorium,
where he could dwell in the calm past, and await
the time when he could again venture forth into
the world&mdash;a world that sorely needed his guiding
hand. When he was allowed to leave the
infirmary, it was not to go to his solitary cell, but
to share the dormitory with the others.</p>

<p>The days and the weeks slipped gently on, the
routine of life in the scriptorium endearing itself
more and more to the newcomer's heart. The
scriptorium at St. Dunstan's was a large chamber
which usually held about a dozen persons, but
which at times permitted of as many as twenty
working together. The Abbot selected the scribes,
no one being allowed to enter the room without his
permission. It was also the duty of the Abbot to
give orders to the Armarius how to portion out
the work, a certain task once assigned, no monk
being permitted to exchange his portion for another.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>Boys and novices wrote letters, while older
monks were selected to make copies of old books
and transcripts of such chronicles as required
rigid accuracy. One was specially selected to
insert rubrics and design ornamental capitals and
other embellishments, while there was a chief
artist to whom were left the important designs.
The Armarius bound the books in wooden covers
to preserve the parchment from mildew and damp.
He was really the librarian, keeping a record of
all books loaned either to the monks for private
study (although he never permitted the rare works
to leave the scriptorium), or to sick monks in the
infirmary. Every volume had to be returned before
the lights were lit, and work ceased in the
scriptorium the instant the daylight failed. The
manuscripts were too precious to be endangered
by artificial light, nor indeed by any kind of heat,
so in winter the monks had to work by the hour
with their fingers benumbed by the cold. The
scribes had no light task. Penned on the margin
of an exquisitely written manuscript, there has
come down to us from those days at least one
pathetic plaint:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"He who does not know how to write imagines it to be no
labor; but though three fingers only hold the pen, the whole
body grows weary."</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>
<p>Robert Annys often watched with interest the
busy Armarius, who had manifold duties. He
kept a careful record of the use of every book;
and at times some distant monastery begged for
the loan of a certain book, and some proper guarantee
must first be secured; or perhaps, if the borrower
were not well-known, a book of equal value
must first be deposited as ample security. Besides
this, it was his duty to provide on the shelves the
material for the work: plenty of parchment, ink
made of soot or sometimes of ivory black, pens
fashioned of the quills of geese or peacocks,
chalk, pumice stones, penknives to cut the parchment,
awls to make the lines, rulers and plummet
to note omissions of text in the margin, and
weights to keep down the vellum.</p>

<p>Not only Annys grew to love his work and to
take a great pride in it, but the absolute silence
of the scriptorium soothed his shattered nerves.
He felt that he could not be in surroundings
more congenial. The monks stepped in and out
noiselessly. If a book was required, it was necessary
only to extend the hand and make a movement
as if turning over the leaves of a book. If
it were a missal that was required, one should
make the sign of a cross; if the gospels, the sign
of the cross on the forehead; if a tract, one hand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>was laid on the abdomen, the other on the mouth;
if a pagan work, first the general sign for a book,
and then one scratched the ear with the hand
after the manner of a dog&mdash;for what was a pagan
save an infidel dog? The only time the silence
was permitted to be broken was when a large
number of copies of some popular treatise was
required, in which case a skilful transcriber read
aloud while the others copied at dictation. The
works of Tertullian were given Annys to copy.
Although at a distance, the Bishop yet watched
over him, giving strict orders that no lives of the
saints, or confessions, or any work of religious
exaltation be given to him. His purpose was to
bring Annys back to the world and the present
by other channels,&mdash;to keep his mind on the calm
scholarly days at Balliol, rather than to permit it
to dwell upon the immediate past.</p>

<p>"The sweet yoke of the Lord"&mdash;how often
had Annys come across that phrase in the confessions
and meditations of holy men. And
now for the first time he really understood the
full sweetness of it. Its spell was slowly working
upon him, subtly undermining his resolution
to return to the people. At last the day came
when he thought his work lay within the walls
of the Abbey. There was no one there to tell
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>him his old self was not dead, but slumbering.
As soon as he had signified his intention to take
the vows of their order, he had been intrusted to
the special care of an old monk who spoke to
him from time to time of the discomforts and
humiliations which a monk must be prepared to
bear. At the end of two months he was ready
to listen to the reading of the Rule of St. Benedict,
a voluminous document of seventy-three
chapters. At its conclusion, the reader admonished
him solemnly:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Behold the law under which thou wouldst fight: if thou
canst observe it, enter; if thou canst not, depart in freedom."</p></div>

<p>When June came, this ordeal had been gone
through but once; it would be put to him three
more times during the twelvemonth to follow, and
at the expiration of this period he would be
warned that shortly he would have no power of
leaving. Then, if he still kept to his resolution
of becoming a Benedictine, he would be introduced
into the oratory and there, in the presence
of all the community, before God and all the
saints, would have to promise stability and perpetual
residence, and also reformation of his
morals and obedience under pain of eternal damnation.
He would then make a declaration of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>this pledge in writing with his own hand, and
place it upon the altar; then he must throw himself
at the feet of each of the brethren singly, begging
them to pray for him. From that day forth
he would be regarded as a member of the
community.</p>

<h2>XXIV</h2>


<p>When the note reached Matilda, telling of his
decision to become a Benedictine monk, and imploring
her to forget him and to wed Richard
Meryl, who was far worthier of her than he, her
tears flowed, not at her own loss, for that she had
long since schooled herself to bear, but at the
people's loss in their leader.</p>

<p>Robert Annys, her Robert Annys, a Benedictine!
Impossible! How often in the sweet days
of their companionship had he railed bitterly
against those so-called Christians that buried
their noses in ponderous tomes of Meditations
on the Future Life, while Satan grimly did his
work on the life going on about him. How his
impatience had flashed out against those that
shut their eyes to Christ's true mission in the
world, and continued in the even tenor of their
way within the sheltered cloister, while without
the cold north winds blew, and crops failed, and
sheep died by the hundred, and gaunt men looked
into each other's eyes and saw there, not hope
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>and good-fellowship, but only hunger and despair
and a thirst for vengeance. What answer would
such have ready&mdash;he used to say&mdash;at the Tribunal
of the Great Judge, when asked after the
workers of the world? Would their answers
differ any from that made by baron or bailiff,
the same miserable palliation that trembled on
the lips of guilty Cain?</p>

<p>Robert Annys, her Robert Annys, a Benedictine!
He who had always translated religion
into helpfulness, had he, then, after all, lowered
his colors and aligned himself with the good but
impotent dreamers of the earth? Now she regretted
that her pride had let him go from her
without one plea for Piers. That would not have
been a plea for herself. And perhaps she could
have saved him this defeat. Yet she comforted
herself with the thought that it could not last.
Some day&mdash;she hoped before he would take the
vows of his order&mdash;some day, amid the peace
and calm of the cloisters, the voice of the down-trodden
people, his once-beloved, ever-beloved
people, would reach him, and he would fling off
the cowl, to place himself again at their head.</p>

<p>For indeed their need of him was great. As
the time drew near for the march on to Blackheath,
it was impossible to restrain their impatience.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>Everywhere slumbered fires that needed
but a puff to burst into instant flame. Here it
was a quarrel of long standing with an abbey
for the right to grind one's own corn; there it
was the insolence of a poll-tax collector; again it
was a bailiff seeking a runaway serf: any pretext
served to fan the smouldering embers. Matilda
was too loyal a pupil of Robert Annys not to
watch anxiously the constantly increasing outbursts
of violence. She knew how much depended
on the orderliness and self-control of
those who were to demand their freedom of their
King.</p>

<p>During these days she prayed much, and pored
for long hours at a time over her Bible. Whatever
unhappiness her love for Robert Annys had
caused her, at least it had brought her the joy of
reading for herself in the Wonderful Book. It
was everything to her, her one beloved companion,
for now she lived utterly alone. Her grandmother
was no more. When Rose went from
her, she became a helpless paralytic, only speaking
a minute before her death, when she uttered
some wild curses in which two generations of de
Leauforts&mdash;uncle and nephew&mdash;were strangely
blended. Meryl had not yet returned from his
mission. Matilda lived in a blessed companionship
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>with her Saviour, sharing in every act of His
life, letting every precious word that had fallen
from His lips sink deeply into her heart. It was
a marvellous experience, which broadened and
developed her receptive nature. She burned with
a passionate desire to make His Presence real to
those about her. She resolved to take up that
part of Robert's work&mdash;the bringing of the Gospel
to the people. There could be no greater
service on earth, and there was comfort in the
consciousness of continuing <em>his</em> work. She was
sure the people needed no other guidance than
the Bible in their hands. For what knew the
untutored peasant girl of history, of the slow,
painful steps by which Christianity was won for
the world? of the contamination in the very forces
that it conquered? She knew only the beautiful
simplicity of Christ's mandates, and felt a growing
horror for the intricacies of ritualistic worship.
What knew she of Donations of Constantine, of
the slow, steady growth of the temporal dominions
of the Papacy? She filled her heart to overflowing
with His words of peace and charity, and
gazed with growing scorn at the bickerings and
warfare waged by the Head of Holy Church.</p>

<p>She knew that in Rome there stood the Church
of St. Peter's. It had twenty-nine steps leading
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>up to its doors. When you go up or down, if
you say a prayer, you shall have seven years' pardon
for every step. Inside there are seven principal
altars. At each of these you can obtain
seven years' pardon. At the high altar pardon
is given for twenty years. If you time your visit
between Maunday and Lammas, you obtain fourteen
thousand years' pardon. What could this all
mean to her? What knew she of the need to
encourage pilgrimages to Rome, to fasten the eyes
of the world upon it? What knew she of the
magnificent statesmanship that could hold the
Holy City in the imagination of all&mdash;believer and
pagan alike&mdash;glorious, impregnable, supreme?</p>

<p>She knew only that Jesus granted absolution
through much suffering and great faith, a real
change of heart. A small detail which, in the
calculation of the shrewd Pope, had been relegated
to comparative unimportance.</p>

<p>So, in the same way, she looked about her on
the condition of the serfs, and saw nothing of the
slow upbuilding of the feudal system, of the service
that once had meaning, but only the apostolic
equality of all men and the nobility of labor.</p>

<p>All men were created in the image of God, and
she wanted to see all men free and equal. Nevertheless,
she had a horror of violence. She was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>fearful of the spectre of the wild beast that stalked
ever behind the noble purposes of the Uprising.</p>

<p>Once she encountered some men riotously returning
from the sacking of the house of the
collector of the latest poll-tax. Some staggered
under the weight of the valuables which they
had carried off, while others staggered under the
strong wines which they had poured down their
throats. Her quick indignation was aroused.</p>

<p>"Thieves! Robbers! Despoilers! How can
ye so bring disgrace on the Great Society!"</p>

<p>But the leader only laughed, and called out in
his thickened voice:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Nonsense, girl! A poll-tax collector&mdash;'tis no
thievery, my dear, but a putting back into our own
pockets what he did take from ours." And they
passed on, laughing and hiccoughing.</p>

<p>Another time she came across a crowd hanging
on the words of an evil-faced man, who was urging
them to attack a neighboring castle.</p>

<p>"It will not be the only castle to fall before
us," he boasted.</p>

<p>It disheartened her to see this fellow seeking
his own ends under the pretence of the common
good.</p>

<p>"How long since was it that Sir John dismissed
you as a dishonest bailiff?" she cried. And the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>fellow turned purple and then took to his heels,
followed by the jeers of the crowd. She did what
she could, but she realized that it was but little.
How long before Robert Annys would return to
them? How long?</p>

<p>One day Richard Meryl came back. He approached
the village at a moment when a large
crowd had gathered about one who was holding
forth on the ever popular text of Adam and
Eve.</p>

<p>"'Adam delved and Eve span,'" the fellow was
saying. "So ho! where, then, was our great
gentleman? Where, then, was our fine Lord
looking down from his costly manor-house upon
his men sweating and toiling in the fields? And
where was the fine lady lolling at her ease,
wrapped in dainty raiments fashioned by the
hand of others? <em>If Eve span not she went naked,
and if her lord delved not he went hungry.</em> And
now tell me, if the good God saw fit to make the
world in the first place only of workers and no
laggards, who, then, brought the laggards into
the world?"</p>

<p>"The Devil, the Devil, the Evil One," shouted
several. Then cries came from all sides, while
the speaker's face glowed with satisfaction:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Put them out!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>
<p>"Burn them out!"</p>

<p>"Starve them out!"</p>

<p>Just then Meryl recognized Matilda, standing
among the others, pale as death, but with a great
light flaming in her eyes. He left off watching
the speaker and glued his hungry eyes upon her
face. He saw with a sinking heart how thin and
haggard it was, and a vague terror stole over him.
He had schooled himself all this time to bear the
sight of her happiness, and now he saw that he
must begin all over again to bear the sight of her
misery.</p>

<p>The man's strident voice swept on: "By God!
men of Cambridgeshire, when every manor-house
lieth in ashes the Lords will no longer refuse to
grant us our quit-rents. Then shall we be able to
till a bit of land in freedom and we shall grind
our corn where we will, and there shall be no
masters to own us body and soul."</p>

<p>"Stay!"</p>

<p>It was Matilda. The people turned, amazed at
her boldness.</p>

<p>"How foolishly thou dost rant, Peter Wells!"
she said in a clear, steady voice that all marvelled
at. "Wot ye not, neighbors, that even
Piers Ploughman tells us we must have overlords
and rulers? Wot ye not that when the rats and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>mice desired to put to death all the cats in the
realm that one wise rat spake and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'If we have no cats over us, sure all the rats
will eat one another!'</p>

<p>"Now, what good will ever come of violence and
bloodshed? Oh, surely, ye are of little faith, for
if ye believed in the justice of your Cause ye would
be satisfied to stand before the kind King with no
weapons in your hands save just rightwiseness.
Ye would not put your trust in burning and sacking
and pillaging. Oh, shame, shame upon you!"</p>

<p>There were some that seemed impressed by the
girl's words, but Peter shrugged his shoulders
roughly. "Bah! spoken like thy soft-hearted poor
priest, Robert Annys. He was forever bidding
us wait. <em>Wait!</em> and for what?" he blazed out
furiously&mdash;"for another poll-tax to be wrung
from the poor while the rich hide their treasure
between the folds of the Justices' gowns? Wait?
for what? For more laws to be passed making it
a crime to seek honest labor? for more raping of
our women? Nay, let thy Robert Annys face me,
and I shall tell him we have waited too long
already."</p>

<p>Her head drooped. Ah, if he would but face
them!</p>

<p>"Where is Robert Annys? Why is he not here
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>to help us?" queried one, impatiently. Matilda
trembled and swayed as if she would fall, and the
shadows darkened under her glowing eyes. Meryl
watched her closely.</p>

<p>"Why does he not come back to us?" repeated
the voice. "Where does he tarry so long?"</p>

<p>It would never do to let these wild men suspect
the truth. She nerved herself to answer.</p>

<p>"Did ye not yourselves send him on a dangerous
mission into Kent?" she asked. There was something
unfamiliar in her voice that puzzled Meryl.</p>

<p>"It is long since time that he returned," muttered
the fellow, and Matilda broke out with a
sudden impatience: "Mayhap he is risking his
life even now for us while ye stand idly talking.
Learn to obey, bide ye in patience, for it lacks not
many days before the word will be spoken and
then ye may go forth as honest men."</p>

<p>Then Meryl approached her and drew her aside,
and, as she recognized him, she fell sobbing into
his arms.</p>

<p>He conducted her home, and then he asked the
meaning of it all.</p>

<p>"Thou art unhappy. Tell me what has happened.
And where is Robert Annys?"</p>

<p>"Said I not already that he was in Kent?" she
whispered.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>
<p>"Nay," he said impatiently, "thy face is far too
dear to me to permit it to deceive."</p>

<p>As she did not reply to this, he gazed at her in
gloomy silence for a while, and then spoke with a
certain stern deliberateness.</p>

<p>"He is not in Kent."</p>

<p>She quivered. "How should I know more than
I have said?" she asked plaintively.</p>

<p>"'How should I know,'" he mocked; "I left
thee on the eve of wedding Robert Annys. Art
thou his wife?"</p>

<p>"Nay!"</p>

<p>"Art thou betrothed?"</p>

<p>"Nay!"</p>

<p>"What? not even betrothed?" Then in a low,
trembling voice, "Has he wronged thee?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Richard, for shame! for shame!"</p>

<p>"When did he go away?"</p>

<p>"The second day of the Stourbridge Fair."</p>

<p>"And thou hast not seen him since?" he asked
in amazement.</p>

<p>"Nay, I have not seen him since."</p>

<p>He paced up and down a few times, and then
he came back to her and looked down on her,
sullen, uncertain, not knowing what to think.
"Listen!" at last he broke out, "I return and
find thee unhappy. He must have caused this.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>Tell me the truth and the whole truth, or I
shall seek him if it be to the end of the earth,
and I shall wring the truth from him if it has to
be from his dying lips. Dost understand?"</p>

<p>She understood. But before she would speak,
she made him promise solemnly not to reveal his
whereabouts. It was a promise given most reluctantly,
nevertheless she felt certain it would not
be broken.</p>

<p>He received the news with amazement and
incredulity just as she had done. Impossible!
Robert Annys a Benedictine? Impossible! "What
is it that thou art keeping from me? What drove
him to this?"</p>

<p>He paced up and down in deep thought. Suddenly
he stood before her again and asked abruptly,
"Where is Rose?"</p>

<p>In a few words she told him of Rose's flight
and the death of her grandmother.</p>

<p>"When did Rose go?"</p>

<p>"The second day of the Stourbridge Fair," she
said.</p>

<p>Meryl's face darkened. "How? the very day
he went? What is this that thou art telling
me?"</p>

<p>The blood leapt to her cheeks, she looked up
into his stormy eyes, protesting, denying&mdash;she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>scarce knew what&mdash;"Nay, nay, Richard! How
canst thou? Believe me, thou art quite wrong&mdash;She"&mdash;but
the long strain of the past months had
worn on her and her self-control was at an end.
She fled into the house, weeping bitterly, while
he left in a turmoil, angry, sore at heart.</p>

<p>During the next few days, he deeply regretted
his promise. He saw the growing rebellion against
the harsh landlordism of the monastery; he knew
but a word would send dozens of the men rioting
at the gates. It was easy to predict what would
happen if he led them there and then cried out
that their former leader was within, a deserter,
caring naught for them and their woes, concerning
himself solely with Aves and Breviaries. Ah,
he would not stay behind, either! His blood leapt
at the thought of breaking down the doors with
the maddened men at his heels, of beating his way
through the surging crowd, of dragging Annys
from his cell and flinging him, with all the guilt
of his miserable soul upon him, straight to the
judgment seat. He had guessed something of the
truth. He knew the nature of Rose Westel, he
knew also that it must have taken some tremendous
upheaval to send Robert Annys knocking at
St. Dunstan's. But there was no pity in his
heart for the struggle which his friend must have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>waged, nothing but a blind rage against the man
who had broken Matilda's heart.</p>

<p>He had no patience to bide at home. He
joined a party of desperate men who were setting
out for Ely on a wild errand. His mood had
entirely changed. He derived a certain fierce
satisfaction in rousing the people to immediate
action, in stirring them to commit deeds of violence&mdash;in
short, to do all that Robert Annys
would have deplored. It was the only way there
was left to fight him&mdash;he had not chosen the
weapons, it was all that was left him.</p>

<p>Soon among all the men of the Bury there was
not one more reckless, more feared, than he.</p>

<h2>XXV</h2>


<p>Robert Annys had been at the Abbey of St.
Dunstan for six months only, and he was still
going through his novitiate, when he received the
signal distinction of being appointed the chronicler
of the Abbey. It was a position of great
trust, and never before in the history of the monastery
had it been given to a mere novitiate. To
Annys there was a profound inspiration in taking
up a task that had been handed down from generation
to generation through an unbroken line of
chroniclers of whom the Abbey was justly proud.
Well he knew that the world owed a great debt
to those patient, industrious monks in every land,
who faithfully set down the doings of those that
lived in the world. Surely if it had been left to
those that spent their lives in the midst of the
fray, it had never been done&mdash;not alone from
lack of time, but from lack of clerkly knowledge
as well. Right glad he was to take up the task
done by that Gildas who had painted in fiery
colors the misery of the Britons when the Romans
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>departed; by the venerable Bede, father of Catholic
history; by Ingulphus, Abbot of Croyland; by
William of Malmesbury, "the Great Chronicler,"
fountain-head of English history, chronicler of the
monastery of Malmesbury, who grew so to love
his work that he refused to give it up to become
Abbot of the monastery.</p>

<p>The great book into which the Chronicle of St.
Dunstan was entered was treated with the greatest
possible veneration. It lay in a conspicuous place
in the scriptorium, and no one but the chronicler
was permitted to make entries in it. When any
great piece of news was brought to the monastery
that seemed worth recording, the person giving
the information wrote out his version of the story
on a loose piece of parchment and slipped his
communication into the book of annals for the
authorized compiler to make use of in any way
that seemed best to him after due examination of
the evidence.</p>

<p>There came a day in June, a wonderful day
when Nature put forth at once all her attractions
in one burst of rapture after the long, hard winter.
The garden in the close was one mass of brilliant
color, and the air was overpoweringly languorous
with the sweet fragrance. Annys went to his
daily task reluctantly, so ardently did Nature woo
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>him to remain outdoors. As he stood for a
moment hesitating on the threshold of the scriptorium,
the words of the poet Chaucer came to
him:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">"Whan that the month of May</div>
      <div class="verse">Is comen, and that I hear the foules sing,</div>
      <div class="verse">And that the flowres ginnen for to spring,</div>
      <div class="verse">Farwell my booke, and my devotion."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>He smiled to find how perfectly the poet had
expressed his own mood. He seldom found in
Chaucer's joyous, buoyant nature a note that
appealed to him so intimately as did the voice
of the sombre wanderer among the Malvern Hills.
At last he turned his back resolutely upon the
picture of loveliness and entered the scriptorium.
The scene that greeted his eyes was a busy one,
and yet one of great charm. Not one black-robed
form that was not earnestly engaged in work of
some kind; here one bending closely over some
old Latin text that had been destroyed almost
beyond recognition; there one deftly engaged in
cutting great sheets of vellum; over in a corner an
artist holding his hand poised in uncertainty over
several pots of color; near him was one sharpening
a quill; another patiently awaited his turn
for some longed-for volume; and yet two more
were carefully copying a score of music with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>large notes, that the beginners in the choir could
easily read it. Work, and no shirking of it, yet
an atmosphere of perfect peace and content, for
it was work done in joy, and therefore lifted to
the realm of Art.</p>

<p>Oh, the wonderful, indescribable peace! How
far off were the turmoil, the doubt, the responsibility,
the unjoyful, incessant toil, the infinite woe,
the weary burden of the world. Even as the pioneer
monks had built their monasteries always in
some hidden vale protected by high hills from the
north winds that their crops might flourish, so their
lives were protected from all contact with the great
currents of action that swept by outside. The
storm-centres of protest and unrest, the whirlwinds
of revolt&mdash;all passed over and around the walls of
the monastery, unknown, unfelt, unsuggested.</p>

<p>Robert Annys owed much to the Abbey of St.
Dunstan. He had been as a helpless mariner in
the fierce grip of a storm. He had been swept
by tumultuous waves, his ears had been deafened
by the awful voices of the warring elements, and
suddenly he had drifted into a sheltered harbor,
and the same winds that had beaten furiously upon
him, here but peacefully rocked his bark upon
the quiet waters.</p>

<p>Poor fool! before he had sought a haven here,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>how the woe of the world had weighed upon him!
How foolish he had been to feel a personal responsibility
in the actions of Divine Providence!
There were some mortals who acted as if all the
wrongs on earth were to be righted between sunrise
and sunset. He had been one of those.
How faintly the echoes of his past existence came
to him here.</p>

<p>He opened the ponderous volume. He had
been thinking the day before, when the daylight
had faded and he had reluctantly left his work, of
a new and charming device for an initial letter H,
which he had been about to trace. It was to be
something quite novel in the way of decoration,
and he expected to receive great approbation for
it. His fingers hovered in some uncertainty over
the brushes before he could make up his mind
which one was the very finest. Then, having
made the auspicious selection, it remained for him
to choose between a paint of brilliant scarlet or one
with the depth of the sun-warmed strawberry in it.
Finally he chose the brilliant scarlet. As he bent
over the page, he noticed for the first time a slip
of paper which had evidently been placed between
the pages of the Chronicle during his absence.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The outbreak of the rustics at the Bury is terrorizing the
true and loyal men of the realm," it began. "On Saturday last,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>under the leadership of one Richard Meryl, the unruly mob
attacked the abbey and plundered it, taking away a rich cross,
chalices of gold, and many jewels, to the amount of a thousand
pounds, and did much mischief to the buildings.</p>

<p>"The prior, Sir John de Cambridge, fled, under cover of
darkness, hoping to reach Ely. But the following day the mob
discovered him in the woods near Newmarket. They conducted
him to Newmarket, where, all night long, they did most
blasphemously mock him; kneeling before him, they cried,
'Hail Master!' and striking him with their hands, they cried,
'Prophesy who smote thee!'</p>

<p>"At break of day, the rioters led their victim back to Mildenhall,
where they were joined by many people from the Bury.
Here they held a council by which the prior was condemned to
instant execution. After allowing him the privilege of confession,
his head was severed from his body at a single blow. The
excited rabble cried, 'See the traitor's head!' 'Happy the day
that sees our wish accomplished!'</p>

<p>"Thus they came and went as masters, those who once had
been slaves of the lowest order."</p></div>

<p>The room swam about him for an instant. He
was obliged to clutch the high desk upon which
the folio rested to save himself from falling. He
looked at the indifferent backs of the monks bending
over their work; a great fury came over him,
and he longed to strike and beat them, that they
could so placidly pore over their books, while this
thing was going on outside. Before his agitation
was noticed, he had recovered sufficiently to ask
permission to leave the scriptorium and seek the
air in the close.</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>



<h2>XXVI</h2>


<p>The great Uprising had come. The world
stood utterly aghast at the spectacle of the plain
rustics throwing down the plough and shouldering
the axe against their rightful lords and masters.
The bravest warriors shrank affrighted
before the poorly accoutred insurgents, for the
terror of a new Idea was upon them. What was
this strange force that was turning upside down
the recognized laws of society? Behind the
rusty, cracked weapons of the mob stalked the
spectre of a coming Democracy. No wonder
that the most hardened warriors quailed at the
thought of fighting an intangible foe. No wonder
that the most skilful captains lost their heads
and stood agape.</p>

<p>Ah, where was that orderly assembly of which
Annys had so fondly dreamed? That assembly of
fifty thousand strong gathering together from all
parts of the realm to appear in all loyalty and
obedience before their King?</p>

<p>In the close he paced up and down in feverish
excitement. The moment toward which for so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>long his eyes had been strained had at last
arrived. Without him the people were assembling
and marching on to seek the King and
have their wrongs redressed. Without him&mdash;yes,
and without his restraining touch. What
he had dreaded, then, had happened&mdash;the wild
beast which had slumbered for so long within
the breasts of the rustics was now awake and
growling forth its rage. The forces of greed and
revenge, of hatred and envy, were unloosed upon
society, and no one apparently had the power to
chain them again.</p>

<p>"Behold, we are honest men"&mdash;he had
dreamed they would say&mdash;"working and travailing
from dawn to sunset, and with but little in our
stomachs and less on our backs. Thus do we
labor, valued at less than our master's sheep, and
hardly as much as his swine. Yet, nevertheless,
are we men created in the divine image of God, as
Holy Writ tells us, men even like unto you, O
King, alike born and buried and taken up into
immortality or cast down into the pit of hell. We
are judged, not by the extent of our possessions
by the Great Judge of the Universe, but by that
which lieth in our hearts. We want, O King, to
be free men. We ask that there be no further
serfs in all England. Let all work be free and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>willing and it will be the better for us all&mdash;for
our masters as well as for us."</p>

<p>Was there no one in all the broad land to restrain
the people from violence and tell them that
they were ruining their own cause? No one?
A voice whispered within him that there had
been one, but he had deserted the cause and withdrawn
himself into a monastery, and was more concerned
with the doings of the Past, alack! than
the moulding of the Future.</p>

<p>Yet surely he could not be the only one. He
shrank from realizing to the full the consequences
of his own action. And Richard! Hot-headed,
misguided Richard at the head! It was terrible!</p>

<p>He must know the worst. Perhaps the accounts
had been exaggerated. Perhaps there was
yet worse to come. In any case, as chronicler, it
was his duty to discover by what means the news
had been brought. He inquired of a brother, and
learned that the news had been brought from the
Bury by a messenger who had lingered and insisted
upon having audience with the chronicler.</p>

<p>"With me? Some one seeks audience with
me?" he asked uneasily.</p>

<p>He paced up and down restlessly while the
other went to conduct the messenger to him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>Who could it be? he had cut himself so completely
from the world and its affairs.</p>

<p>He was amazed to recognize in the messenger
young Robert Shepherd, whom he had known at
the Bury.</p>

<p>"Tell me," he began eagerly, "you are from
the Bury. Is it so bad, then? The Uprising has
begun?"</p>

<p>"Begun? Ah, of a truth begun! There is no
ending it now, save the whole land lie at our
feet!"</p>

<p>"But how comes it that Robert Shepherd
brings the news, written by one clearly against
us?"</p>

<p>The lad reddened. "It was safer not to refuse
the monk's request," he said, "and it did no harm
to the Cause. Let the monks rant as they will.
We have wrung the freedom of the town from
them. They were all in a panic. Besides," he
added, "I bear with me also another message of
very different complexion."</p>

<p>But of this Annys took no heed. "Tell me,"
he urged, "Richard Meryl, my friend, he was there,
a leader among them&mdash;what of him?"</p>

<p>"Ah, do not ask me," faltered Shepherd. "It
is too terrible."</p>

<p>Annys grasped one of the pillars for support.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>"What, Richard! hurt? dead? quick, what has
happened?"</p>

<p>"Yea, he is dead," answered the lad, solemnly.</p>

<p>For an instant Annys swayed. He placed one
hand on his heart, and closed his eyes. The other
looked at him anxiously.</p>

<p>"Tell me all!" ordered Annys, hoarsely.</p>

<p>"It was terrible, yet it was fine too. He exposed
himself recklessly, and was caught, and they
offered his freedom, if he would but persuade his
followers to give back the charters to the monks,
and disperse in orderly fashion to their homes."</p>

<p>"Ah! and he?"</p>

<p>"They led him, the next day, bound securely,
to the market place, where he addressed the men.
Some of them looked up at him sullenly, and they
murmured threateningly, for they had been told
that he had purchased his life with their defeat.</p>

<p>"But he fooled them all, for he stood there looking
proudly down upon them, with the sky no
bluer than his eyes, and his fair hair curled as a
little child's low over his brow and neck. Ah, I
tell you an Ave rose to my lips&mdash;for I never once
doubted him&mdash;as I saw him standing there, so
brave, so glorious&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, I wist well how glorious!" groaned Annys,
brokenly.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>
<p>"And no sooner was there silence than he cried
out clearly so that all could hear:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Fellows! Take no thought for my trouble, for
if I die, I shall die for the cause of Freedom which
we have won, counting myself happy to end my
life by such a martyrdom. Do, then, to-day as ye
would have done, had I been killed yesterday.'"</p>

<p>"My brave Richard! And then?"</p>

<p>"And then an axe crashed through his skull.
But his murderers did not live long enough to
gloat over their work."</p>

<p>"Richard, my brother! That I had died for
thee!"</p>

<p>The lad was deeply affected by his own recital.
He remained silent an instant and then said suddenly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"But I waste precious time. I bear an urgent
message from Matilda that you should go at once
to Ely."</p>

<p>"To Ely? I? Wherefore?"</p>

<p>"Her message I committed to memory, word for
word: 'It is too late to do aught at the Bury, but
fly to Ely, that the people can be saved from grave
danger.'"</p>

<p>"How knows she this?"</p>

<p>"Her cousin Rose sent to her from Ely, from
the Castle."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>
<p>"Rose at the Castle?"</p>

<p>"Knew you not she has long been the Baron's
favorite?"</p>

<p>"My God! I cannot go there!"</p>

<p>"But it must be. Her message to Matilda ran
that no one but Robert Annys could save the
people."</p>

<p>"Ah, that I could save them!" His head drooped.
"Alas, alas, I have forfeited that right. They
would not listen to a monk. They would spurn
me."</p>

<p>"Nay, trust Matilda for that. Until this day I
thought&mdash;and all thought&mdash;Robert Annys was
in Kent."</p>

<p>"How can that be?" he asked, bewildered.
"She knew where I was."</p>

<p>"Aye, but she always hoped you would come
back to us, and kept your place ready for you.
'Tis only to place yourself again at our head!"</p>

<p>Annys was stirred to the depths at this revelation
of Matilda's devotion. Ah, this was the
true heart he had wounded, the love he had
turned from!</p>

<p>"Well, God grant thee right!" he said. "I
pray so."</p>

<p>"Here is a minstrel's garb and badge," said
Shepherd, "sent by Rose to gain admission unquestioned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>to the Castle, for the gentles are
greatly incensed against all poor priests, at whose
door they do lay all the mischief. The Baron is
engaged in securing minstrels from all over
England for his great feast. Approach as one of
those."</p>

<p>"A feast? Wherefore gives he a feast, just at
this time?"</p>

<p>"In honor of his bride who&mdash;"</p>

<p>"His bride? I thought&mdash;and what of Rose?"
stammered Annys.</p>

<p>"Oh, Rose Westel will get lovers a plenty while
men walk the earth who have two eyes in their
head."</p>

<p>"Peace, peace, enough, fellow!"</p>

<p>"Will you go to Ely Castle?"</p>

<p>"Go? You say I can save the people from
grave danger. Then all the abbots in Christendom
could not hold me!"</p>

<p>And as he crossed the stone walk of the cloister,
he walked with a firmer tread and held his
head higher than at any time since he had entered
the Abbey of St. Dunstan.</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>



<h2>XXVII</h2>


<p>Shepherd had spoken truly. The powerful
Baron de Leaufort had wedded the sister of the
great French Count Henri de Harfleur. The
match had been arranged solely by the efforts of
the wily Legate, who had whispered of the charms
and worldly goods of the Countess Flavie, in the
hopes of further cementing the union between
the Church and the English Baronage. The
serfs might recover their reason and the Barons
once again might look with envious eyes upon
the Treasury of the Church. It would do no
harm to wed de Leaufort to an ardent Catholic
such as the Countess had long since proved herself
to be.</p>

<p>This was the motive that brought the Cardinal
Barsini to Ely Castle, but on seeing Rose Westel,
he speedily discovered a new incentive to succeed
in his mission. He went so far as to add a
couple of thousand lires out of his own pocket to
the dowry of the Countess when he saw that the
Baron bit none too greedily at the bait. It never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>entered his mind that he could possibly fail to
find favor in the eyes of Rose Westel, since
he had not been accustomed to encounter opposition
where he chose to distribute his favors.
But from the instant that Rose caught sight of
the smooth, complacent face of the Nuncio, and
noted the quick leap in his eyes as they dwelt on
her, it seemed as if an icy hand had suddenly
clutched at her heart. Something told her that
her happiness was at an end. And she had been
so happy, ecstatically happy. She had grown to
love de Leaufort with that kind of love which
would have stayed with her had he not possessed
a groat in the world. Gladly would she have followed
him to the wars and endured any hardships
so that she might remain by his side. There
were times when she longed ardently that he
might meet with reverses so she might prove
to him how unselfish was her devotion; she
feared that the very ease of her life cheapened
her love for him in his eyes&mdash;made it more
a matter of mere circumstance than it really
was.</p>

<p>One day the Legate had graciously taken her
into his confidence, and told her of his plans both
for the future of the Baron and for herself. She
had shrunk from him and fled to her lover, panting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>and weeping and raving and acting precisely
as she would not have done had the terrible
shock left one grain of reason in her head.</p>

<p>It was after this scene with her that the Legate
had seen fit to increase the dowry of the Countess.</p>

<p>When the Baron returned with his bride, she
was accompanied by a gay retinue, and the Castle
was splendidly decorated in her honor with great
streamers and banners thrown out from floor to
floor, and the finest of tapestries and yards and
yards of cloth of gold hung on the walls of the
chambers. Watchers had been set in the highest
tower so that the party might not arrive unannounced,
and on the very first sign of their
approach, the Baron's sister, accompanied by a
party of guests, descended the terrace to greet
them. At first but a tiny speck of color could
be made out, creeping along the furthest line
of poplars that fringed the river as it drowsily
turned and twisted upon itself, a slender thread
of sunlight far off in the distant fens. A woman,
faint and sick with watching and weeping, peered
from the slit in the tower, and fastened her eyes
on that speck of color which broadened at every
turn, and slowly resolved itself into many colors,
and at last into the separate forms of people on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>horseback&mdash;so that she could distinguish one
from the other, so that her restless, searching
eyes could make out the Countess to be a frail-looking
woman whose tight-fitting riding-habit
revealed every line of her slender, elegant form.
She was glad to see that her expressionless face
was rendered yet more so by the foolish reigning
fashion of plucking the hair from the eyebrows in
order to heighten the forehead.</p>

<p>Far, far down at her feet, from below the drawbridge,
a bit of blue flashed up at her. She
shivered, for she knew it was the moat onto which
her mother in her despair had flung herself from
the lower parapet. The retinue came nearer, she
could see that there were several chaplains and
ladies in waiting among them, but no one was so
noble looking as the Baron in a tight-fitting coat-hardy
of crimson with green shoulder pieces, and
wearing a beautiful crimson cap with a square
top and a rosette of gold in the centre.</p>

<p>For some time after the arrival of the party,
there was a great stir about the Castle, for the
Countess had brought many gifts which had to
be unpacked and arranged in their proper places.
There were great oaken chests containing priestly
vestments for the chaplains, of cloth of gold, of
cerulean tissue embroidered all over with images
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>of the Trinity and the Blessed Virgin, and an
altar-cloth for the chapel, of white velvet embroidered
with a representation of the Salutation of the
Blessed Virgin, and also for the chapel a chalice,
paten, censer, alms-dish, bowls, chandeliers, an exquisite
vase for the holy water, a group of little
silver bells for the Mass, everything of the very
choicest and finest. Then there was a great bed-cover
and curtains of Tripoli silk wrought with
dragons in combat, the deep border embroidered
with a vine pattern, the whole powdered with bezants
of gold. And there were tapestries for two
receiving rooms, of which one was embroidered
with popinjays in worsted and the other with
roses and other flowers in silks. Also the Countess
brought a handsome salt-cellar of silver gilt
with quaint carvings, and studded with rare jewels,
for the great table, and there were gowns of
scarlet and azure and purple velvets embroidered
and powdered over with small pearls, and there
were double cloaks, hoods, and mantles for riding,
besides saddles for herself and her chamber-women,
and her bridal dress, which required careful handling,
for it was of great magnificence, of cloth of
gold tissue, with a mantle and kirtle to correspond.</p>

<p>To do fitting honor to his bride, de Leaufort
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>had long since made preparations on a vast scale
for a great banquet, sparing no pains to make it
the finest and rarest that had ever been held in
those parts. It was well to do honor to his French
bride, and also it was doubly well to give some
notion to the King of his great resources, for
there were times when even Kings had to be
duly impressed with the power of their Barons;
and it was well also for the insolent peasants,
who were creating disturbances here and there,
to be a bit overawed by a great show of wealth
and state.</p>

<p>For some weeks in advance he had caused messages
to be carried all over the land offering liberal
pay to all the minstrels who would come to
the Castle with their instruments, so that when
all were finally gathered together there were over
two hundred minstrels, with their harps, their
psalteries, their rotes and rebecs, their gitternes,
cymbals, and tabors.</p>

<p>The land was scoured for all possible delicacies;
messengers were sent in hot haste to the coast to
secure fresh fish and fetch it back on fast horses
so that it would arrive untainted by the rays
of the hot sun. Great pasties were made and
filled with partridges and quails, with skylarks
and thrushes; and there were jellies that quivered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>mountain-high in every possible hue; while stags,
huge loins of beef, swans, peacocks, and capons
were delivered at the door of the kitchen in an
unending stream.</p>

<p>The Countess made herself exceedingly unpopular
by insisting for some days after her arrival
on partaking of her meals in private,&mdash;she with
the Baron and her own party and the Legate and
only one or two others in the private chamber,
the solar of the Castle. She insisted upon it that
the most refined of the aristocracy were doing
away with the eating of dinners in the great Hall,
which she considered extremely vulgar. To this
whim of his bride de Leaufort gave way very reluctantly,
for well he knew the storm that would
be raised about his ears at this departure from the
established custom, which had been good enough
for his uncle and his uncle's father and grandfather,
and as far back as the line extended. For
the dinner in the great Hall was one of the chief
institutions about which centred the social life of
feudal days. Here the highest nobility and the
plain folk might meet under one roof as the members
of one great family. The most ill-mannered
clout, who could not eat his meat without dripping
the gravy all over his chin and down upon his
breast, could learn daintiness and skill from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>gentles who could deftly use their fingers without
a single drop falling where it should not. Those
into whose lives beauty and grace entered all too
seldom could feast their eyes upon the most beautiful
ladies in the land, their ears upon the most
beautiful music of the day, and their grosser senses
upon the best of wine and food,&mdash;all at the expense
of their lord, whose hospitality was never
questioned. Surely, if it came about that the
quality withdrew themselves into chambers shut
off from the rest of the house, all the music and
song and merriment would leave the great Hall,
and if it were no longer used for feasts and merrymaking,
who knew how long before the goodly
habit of spreading rushes on the floor for the
night might also be given up, and the lonely traveller
be forced to seek quarters in some foul and
filthy inn, where the fleas would see to it that he
rose on the morrow more eagerly than he lay
himself down at night.</p>

<p>So at least for this banquet, the Baron was determined
to have his own way and cling to the
good old customs, save that he set the time much
later than the usual noon hour, that the feast
could last well on into the night,&mdash;an unwonted
dissipation that would make the occasion all the
more memorable.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>
<p>Two hours before sunset the blare of the trumpets
summoned the guests, who gathered together
in the great Court and then entered the Hall two
by two, and made their way along the rows of
tables set the length of the Hall. At these tables
stood a crowd of lesser guests and retainers who
watched the guests of honor proceed to the upper
end of the room, and mount the steps which led
to the carpeted dais upon which stood the splendid
high table of carved oak, now covered completely
with a cloth of fringed and embroidered
white silk strewn with aromatic herbs.</p>

<p>First came the Baron Edmond de Leaufort, his
under short coat of white, elaborately embroidered
in gold, with a long mantle of royal blue
velvet reaching to his toes, and falling over his
shoulders into a great train, which, if measured,
would have come to three yards in length and
more than a dozen yards in width. The hood
and the entire length and breadth of the mantle
were edged with gold, upon which were embroidered
flowers of blue with leaves of green.
The wide, loose sleeves, lined in a silk of delicate
rose color, hung down from the elbows in a long
point which just escaped the ground. The hosen,
which fit so snugly about his calves as to necessitate
a sewing on at each wearing, were of different
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>colors, one of brilliant scarlet, and the other
of white, while the long pointed shoes were of
scarlet. His hair, curled low over his neck and
ears, rested on a stiff ruff of fine white lace
studded with pearls, while over his breast hung
a long golden chain of finest workmanship, almost
touching the links of yet another chain of like
sort which was worn as a girdle low about his
waist. The Countess by his side was gowned in
a kirtle of scarlet cendal, laced close to the body,
over which fell in graceful folds a mantle of rich
green velvet, edged with an intricate pattern outlined
in seed pearls. The sleeves of the kirtle
were as tight as the hosen of the Baron, and
necessitated on each robing the same man&oelig;uvres
with thread and needle. About her hair (which
had been freshly washed in wine to give it the
fashionable gloss) was wound a gorget of finest
white linen striped with wires of gold, which,
after being turned two or three times about the
neck and fastened by a great quantity of pins,
had been raised on each side of the face until
it resembled two great horns&mdash;a fashion which
certainly gave a threatening aspect to the fair
and elegant ladies of the day.</p>

<p>All the guests of both sexes were arrayed in
their most sumptuous robes to do honor to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>feast; yet perhaps in the breast of some of them
was a certain chagrin that it was not the
cold season, so that they might have displayed
their rare and costly ermines, the pride and joy of
the aristocracy. Notwithstanding the absence of
furs, which perhaps were the costliest of all articles
of apparel, there yet was enough gold spent on
the backs of the nobles assembled there to have
clothed in russet cloth the whole of England.</p>

<p>On the procession moved with stately grace to
the accompaniment of the instruments above in
the oriole, the great folk smiling and chatting
among themselves, while the others looked on in
silence. One there was, a wild-eyed man, tall and
lank, in a priest's cassock, who looked on while the
procession passed him, in silence it is true, yet his
face speaking a language more eloquent than that
of the tongue, with a look of contempt and hate
and bitter scorn. Notwithstanding this, it was not
very long before this same fellow seemed to have
utterly forgot his indignation in his satisfaction
over the dainty food that was placed before him.</p>

<p>While the trumpets blew a triumphant fan-fare
the guests seated themselves at the high table so
that their faces were turned toward those below,
the great ewers of chased gold and silver were
passed by lackeys who kneeled before them, followed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>by others bearing napkins of dainty linen,
grace was said by the elegant, courtly Legate, and
the guests were paired off by twos to eat from the
same trenchers and to drink from the same jewelled
goblets. At last the servitors marched in
triumphantly bearing the elaborately decorated
dishes high up over their heads that all might see
and applaud. As the feast proceeded with great
merriment, the going down of the sun slowly cast
the vast chamber into gloom. At a word from
the host, the great candelabra of gold carven into
all sorts of odd designs were borne in with the tall
waxen candles all alight, and set along the table.
Along the lower end of the Hall tall powerful
fellows held flaming torches in their hands for
the illumination of the lesser tables which bore no
costly candelabra, and at the same time for the
comfort of the lackeys ranged along the wall
dealing out wine from the huge casks that were
being rolled into the Hall in a steady procession.</p>

<p>As one by one these flambeau-bearers took
their places, flinging, as they moved, irregular
spots of light into the gathering darkness, there
stole in among the many minstrels gathered high
up in the oriole overhead, one who bore little resemblance
to his comrades. It was a face one
would expect to find bowing low before the altar,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>or elevating the host, not singing the ribald songs
that often enlivened the feasts of the great. But
as the fellow wore conspicuously upon his shoulder
the badge of the Baron's minstrels, no further
heed was taken of him by them than to sit closer
together, that he could get a view of what was
going on below.</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>



<h2>XXVIII</h2>


<p>The newcomer up in the oriole looked down
upon the scene before him as if bewildered by the
weird sight. Every now and then he buried his
face in his hands as if to shut out the picture, and
then suddenly raised it again to stare wildly,
while his lips moved constantly as if in prayer.
The vast height of the great groined roof left the
whole upper portion of the Hall in darkness, with
here and there a bit of carving thrown out into
sudden relief by a flickering torch uplifted in the
arms of one below. Here some fierce dragon
flung itself from the gloom, and as suddenly
retreated; there some monstrous carved face
grinned for an instant and fell back; a griffin
claw struck at the blackness and was itself overcome;
the deep recesses in the mullioned windows
were the home of grewsome mysteries.
The great table on the raised dais was brilliantly
illuminated in spots where the tall gold candelabra
stood. The centrepiece stood out clearly, a
swan in full plumage, its beak gilded, its body silvered,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>resting on a mass of brown pastry painted
green to represent a field of grass. Eight banners
of rose-colored silk surrounded this <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pièce de
résistance</i> and a cloth of the same covered the
mound upon which it was placed, so that it towered
high above all the other dishes. Along the
table shone great golden goblets with wide-open
lids studded with gleaming jewels, silver and gold
salt-cellars of strange designs, and the nef, a great
ship of gold, enamelled with dragons, on four
golden wheels, containing spices and sweetmeats.
Also there were, rare sight indeed, forks of gilded
silver with exquisitely wrought handles, a gift from
the Countess looked upon with small favor by the
conservative Baron.</p>

<p>Between the tiny spots of light, amid the glitter
of gold and silver, gleamed the rich colors of the
costumes, crimson and peacock and emerald, cendals
of delicate blue and royal purple, and the
sparkle of rare jewels. The light fell here and
there on the face of some bearded noble or gentle
lady, while immediately above these, from the tapestried
wall, showed proud peacocks, clusters of
flowers, or scenes from the chase. Over the head
of de Leaufort hung the arms of his house, while
it chanced that just above the Legate snarled the
hideous fangs of a wolf standing at bay.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>
<p>As the trembling Dante gazed awestruck down
into the pit of Hell, so Annys&mdash;for the newcomer
was he&mdash;thinking of the great Florentine,
looked down from the oriole on the scene of
revelry before him. A light song floated down
from the minstrels, silencing the gay chatter,
and turning upwards the faces of all. Among
them flashed for an instant the one face that
stood between Annys and the Grace of God&mdash;the
most beautiful face in all England, and now
the saddest as well.</p>

<p>Then followed the chorus:&mdash;</p>

      <div class="verse">"Cuccu, cuccu, well singes thu, cuccu,</div>

      <div class="verse indent4">Sing cuccu, sing cuccu nu!"</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Next came a quaint request from a sturdy
throat which delighted especially those at the
lower tables:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">"Brynge us home good ale, sir, brynge us home good ale.</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>


<p>These verses done with, a bold spirit from
Oxford arose at one of the lower tables and
launched forth the famous students' drinking
song&mdash;a parody on the Latin hymn "Alleluia."</p>

<p>It came as a not unapt reply to the request of
the thirsty soul:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse indent6">"You will see</div>

      <div class="verse indent6">Semper Clara!"</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>"Beasts," thought Annys, "can they then make
a jest of the most sacred hymns? Is there no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>sense of shame among them all that they laugh
so immoderately?"</p>

<p>Small wonder that, looking down upon them,
the thought of Hell came to him. Surely among
them all was no thought of Heaven or Grace, or
Pity or Fellowship. Here were all the appetites,
Hunger and Lust, and Envy together with Frivolity,
Extravagance and Luxury. No thought here
for the outer world, for poor Piers diking and
delving in the fields. A godless lot they were,
covered with unnecessary clothing, filling themselves
with unnecessary food&mdash;each sense fed to
overflowing with rare odors, rare tastes, rare sights,
rare sounds. Surely minions of the evil one,
these, blithely clutching at their insolent joys at
whatever shameful cost to those less fortunate.</p>

<p>High up in the centre of the vast roof opened
the louvre through which the smoke curled when
the great logs on the andirons in the centre of the
floor were lighted. Through it Annys looked up
and saw the quiet stars shining down. High
Heaven looked on, nor sent a bolt crashing down
upon them all!</p>

<p>Suddenly a face struck at him from a dark
corner, which was momentarily illuminated by a
passing torch. It was the haggard face of the
priest who had sneered as the procession passed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>by. Now the fellow was engaged in cramming
his food down his throat most voraciously, taking
his wine in great gulps, and smacking his lips over
it in a most disgustful manner. His hands trembled
with eagerness, and when the lackey bore
away his horn cup to replenish it, his burning
eyes followed the fellow and never let him out of
their sight until his fingers closed again about the
cup. Annys could not help giving forth a slight
sound like a groan, for the shock was a great one,
since this eager glutton beneath him, this churl,
who had apparently no thought above his plate
and his stomach, was&mdash;would to God there were
room for doubt!&mdash;none other than Will Langland,
his revered poet; Will Langland, the passionate
pleader for the rights of the workers in the
fields; Will Langland, hater of hypocrites, reviler
of lying priests, lover of justice and truth, worshipper
of Honest Toil, sitting here at the Baron's
feast a worthless sycophant.</p>

<p>Oh, something had gone awry with the world.
There was no more faith or honor in the land.
Independence, sturdiness of character, honesty&mdash;all
an idle dream! His heart within him seemed
of a sudden to burst. A black pall came over
his sight, a great fury and rage seized upon him;
he was scarcely longer master of himself; he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>longed to shout some ringing, defiant refrain,
some song of the people.</p>

<p>But he controlled himself with a great effort.
He had come there because his people needed
him. He must not jeopardize the Cause by
revealing his identity. So he made his way from
the oriole, down the winding stairs, out into the
night, a stifled sob on his lips.</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>



<h2>XXIX</h2>


<p>When Annys approached the Castle the following
morning, he learned that the Baron had
gone to one of his manors lying on the highroad
to Sudbury, which was the direct way to the Mile
End. Hearing of the growing boldness of the
insurgents, and having some of his costliest purchases
from the Stourbridge Fair yet stored within
the Manor House, he thought it well to bring them
to the well-protected Castle.</p>

<p>On the terrace Annys hid himself behind an
abutment of a tower, and peered out cautiously
every now and then to see if any one came by who
could get word for him to Rose. As he waited
there came along Will Langland, no longer the
glutton of the night before, but of a sad and
dejected mien, as if his conscience lay none too
easy within his breast.</p>

<p>"Ah, Robert Annys!" he exclaimed, as he
recognized the poor priest whom he had encountered
several times in the past. "How comes it
I find you not with our new masters of England?
What brings a poor priest within the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>Baron's domains? 'Tis enough to make thy
head cease acquaintance with thy neck."</p>

<p>"Better die of an honest twist of the neck, and
have done with it, than from a heart that breaks
within and slowly wastes the blood drop by drop,"
cried Annys, bitterly, turning away his face. He
could not bear it that this man should be his long-idolized
Will Langland.</p>

<p>The poet looked at him long and silently out
of his deep-seated, piercing eyes. The lines about
his mouth deepened; it was evident that the man's
soul wept within him. At last he spoke.</p>

<p>"Ay! if one did but die of a broken heart. Ah,
you would not see Will Langland alive were it so.
If it only were vouchsafed one to die. But alas,
when only the heart is dead, we live on and on,
and play the fool to our clod of clay."</p>

<p>Annys regarded him impatiently. "Little looked
you yestere'en as one whose heart was broken.
You seemed not unjoyful sitting a beggar at my
Lord Baron's table."</p>

<p>A queer look came into Langland's face. "Nay,
not as a beggar," he interposed softly, "not as a
beggar. I keep my Lord's chantry in London
which he did erect for the soul of his mother. I
came but for the feast. I return to London to-morrow."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>
<p>"Then worse than beggar, thou," broke out
Annys, indignantly. "Thou, Will Langland, a
chantry priest, chanting and mumbling some
Latin words for thy belly's hunger! For do you
aught else for the good of the land? Do you feed
the poor, or clothe them? Are you serving Christ
if you but mouth some words over the empty pates
of the gentry so that they have leave to go and
lie as they will ever after? Can this be he who
wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"'Faith without deeds is as dead as a door-tree'?"</p></div>

<p>Langland quivered as if he had received a blow.
"Ah, wot I well what kind of a man that Will
Langland, singer of Piers, should be. Stay! If
it tortures you to see in the gluttonous, servile
chantry priest of yestere'en the poet whom you
honored, doth it not hurt more, ay! a thousand-fold
more, that very Will Langland? Think you
there is one word that these hands have writ that
does not rise up and mock at me? Think you it
is a light thing to be thus crucified, as it were, by
one's own flesh and blood?"</p>

<p>"Surely," he went on, after an instant's pause,
during which he looked sadly away, far into the
distant horizon, as if his own words had stirred
many recollections within him, "surely I can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>be no more hateful in thy sight than in mine
own. Do I not daily curse this weak, lust-loving
clod of flesh that holdeth prisoner a mind
that at least once dreamed noble dreams? Ah,
Robert Annys, thou wouldst weep water fast
enough with both eyes didst know one tenth
part of the unruth of him who walks the earth
as Will Langland."</p>

<p>And he was about to go, when Annys cried:
"Hold! who am I, indeed, that I should judge
thee? Well wot I how oft the deed fits ill with
the creed. But stay, canst get a word to one Rose
Westel in the Castle? But a hint of my presence,
and she will come, as she awaits me." Langland
readily promised to return to the Castle and give
her the message, and Annys again sought his
hiding-place.</p>

<p>He did not have long to wait before Rose
approached. Before he came forward to meet
her, he observed the Legate walking swiftly after
her, so he remained hidden. When Rose saw
that she was being followed, she gave a little gasp
of surprise. "I thought you had gone with my
Lord," she said to the Cardinal Legate.</p>

<p>His eyes gloated over her beauty as he replied.
"Thou knowest, little one, I could not find it in
my heart to leave thee."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span></p>
<p>"Oh, can you never let me be?" she moaned.</p>

<p>"So ho, my fine lady! So ho, still scornful even
after thy lover has tired of thee and left his beautiful
Rose with her petals falling about her on the
ground, for him who chooses to pick them up and
enjoy their fragrance?" He folded his arms and
looked down upon her, smiling maliciously.</p>

<p>"Then not for you, not for you, Pierre Barsini,
shall they lie there," she answered angrily, stamping
her foot; "why do you follow me about and
torture me so? What have I done to you that
you should so gloat over my misery? Can you
not let me be since I am unhappy enough to suit
even you?"</p>

<p>A sardonic smile shot across the Cardinal's face.
"Done to me," he repeated, "what have you done
to me? Oh, nothing,&mdash;nothing,&mdash;only awakened
within me the fires of Hell, robbed me of my sleep
and all desire for food, made my waking moments
a torture, and my nights a tantalus of entrancing
visions, changed me one instant into a drivelling
idiot,&mdash;and the next into a cruel demon with no
mercy whatever in my heart. Why seek to make
me hate thee? Be mine, and I shall provide
for thee a state which you, in England, know
naught of. In Rome you will be a very princess.
Basta! I could almost laugh to think
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>of the Cardinal Barsini begging for a woman's
favors."</p>

<p>The girl smiled to think that there was a time,
not so very long ago, when such talk might have
had weight with her.</p>

<p>He misinterpreted the smile. "Be not so cruel,"
he said, reaching forth his arms. But she sprang
back with horror in her face.</p>

<p>"Sooner than give myself to thee," she cried
vehemently, "I would cheerfully seek out the
lowliest churl who slinks on his foul litter."</p>

<p>The haughty Legate paled with rage; for an
instant he regarded in stony silence the beautiful
girl who dared to defy him so insolently, then,
drawing himself up to his full height, with one
arm raised high above his head, as a last resort to
compel her to his will, he launched forth the awful
words of excommunication from the Church.</p>

<p>But now Annys could stand it no longer.
Dashing from his hiding-place, and facing the
Legate, trembling with fierce indignation, he
cried:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Cast out from the body of the Church,
doomed to everlasting hell-fire, torture without
end.' It is you, you foul fiend in holy garb, and
not this woman, that should be cast out."</p>

<p>The Legate smiled, a cold, hard smile, fully
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>master of himself again. "Pardon me, Sir Knight,"
he remarked with studied politeness, "had I known
that the lady had decided already to comfort herself
with another gallant, I should not have presumed
to press my suit."</p>

<p>"You liar, you craven-hearted liar," exclaimed
Annys, hotly.</p>

<p>"Well, then, if I mistake, for your language
is not of the choicest,&mdash;and so I marvel at the
lady's favor shown you,&mdash;what is it that brings
the most holy monk from his monastery masquerading
in minstrels garb?"</p>

<p>Then Annys became aware of his minstrel's
badge still clinging to his shoulder. Hastily
tearing it off, he retorted scornfully:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Masquerade indeed! By Mary in Heaven, I
know not why the words do not choke thee in
thy throat. <em>I</em> masquerade forsooth! And does
he not masquerade rather who dares to wear the
holy garb of a priest of God and uses the most
solemn offices of Holy Church to serve his own
base purposes? It is thou who art masquerading
and in a priest's frock. Go, get thee a suit of
flaming scarlet, and let thy cloven foot and thy
long tail show honestly, and then, and then only,
shall I not accuse thee of masquerading."</p>

<p>The Legate's eyes blazed with fury. "Think
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>not that I do not know you, Robert Annys, for
well do I now remember that lying, sedition-loving
tongue. I shall have the hue and cry set after
you. I shall accuse you of coming here and
seeking to set the insurgents against the Baron.
You shall yet be quartered and strung for this
day's work." And he swept by.</p>

<p>"Quick, quick," cried Rose, "he is a dangerous
enemy. Meet me down by the river and tie a bit
of white about the willow bush that hides thee.
Await me there. Lose not an instant."</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>



<h2>XXX</h2>


<p>Some hours elapsed before Rose Westel could
escape unnoticed to the hiding-place by the river.
As Annys stepped forth, Rose's heart sank within
her, for his face was set and hard. Could she
accomplish her purpose? Was this unbending
monk the passionate lover she had once known?</p>

<p>"I was sent for," he began coldly, "in the name
of my people, or I should not have come. Delay
me not, there is much work to be done."</p>

<p>"I will be brief," she said guardedly. "They
are about to attack the Manor House where the
Baron has gone. I tried to keep him here, I told
him his life was in danger, but he only laughed
at me for my pains."</p>

<p>A swift gleam of indignation shot over his
drawn face.</p>

<p>"Hast sent then for me to save thy lover, <em>for
me</em>?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Nay, I have sent for thee to save my soul," she
said, with a pitiful ghost of her old smile, her old
spirit.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span></p>
<p>"It is not given a priest of God to shrive an
unrepentant harlot," was his impetuous answer.</p>

<p>"You are even as other priests, who speak ever
by rote," flashed from her angrily. "An unrepentant
harlot, if you will, but a better woman than that
haughty, self-willed girl the world called 'good.'
I fled from the sight of suffering in others, I
cared only for my own pleasures, for no one save
myself. Now go about the Castle and ask of
Rose Westel, discover what kind of name she
bears, count the friends who love her and whom
she serves, fit the deeds she does with the selfish
aloofness of that girl I was, and tell me which
was the better woman. Ay, look at me, look at
me," she ended passionately, "is it not written on
my face?"</p>

<p>He looked gravely down upon her. Ah, not
lightly had she loved, either! Love indeed had
given her a soul.</p>

<p>"Yes, the heart is a great teacher," he said
softly.</p>

<p>"It is not possible that the good Father can
cast one to hell whose sole sin was in overmuch
loving," she said.</p>

<p>"Whose sole sin was in overmuch loving."
How often had he prayed that might be so.</p>

<p>"No," she repeated, with a certain sad dignity,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>"I have not sent for you because I sinned
through love, but because I sinned through hate."</p>

<p>"Through hate? How?"</p>

<p>She pressed two trembling fingers on her burning
eyelids for an instant, and then kneeled before
him and looked up piteously into his hardened
face.</p>

<p>"I never knew that one could suffer as I suffered
when that woman came&mdash;that woman to
lie where I have lain, to kiss where I have kissed&mdash;that
woman&mdash;ah!&mdash;I was wild&mdash;out of my
senses when I sought John Kyrkeby and whispered
to him that I was forced by the Baron."</p>

<p>He was about to speak, but she silenced him
with a gesture. "It was a lie, a base lie," she said,
reddening with shame; "but heed not that. John
Kyrkeby left me hot with anger to stir up his
fellows against the Baron."</p>

<p>"Ah, girl," he said sadly, "think not your words
will be answerable for what follows. The people
have more&mdash;far more against the Baron de
Leaufort than the undoing of one maid. He
has been a hard taskmaster, and has ever refused
the quit-rent."</p>

<p>"The very words John Kyrkeby spake when
I went again to him wild at my own deed. He
said to me then that no one could prevent the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>men from marching on the Manor save that
Robert Annys would come before them again as
their leader. He alone could keep their eyes
fixed on Blackheath.</p>

<p>"I was mad, mad," she continued, now walking
up and down in agony, "mad, mad. I thought
only that she would not have him. I forgot
that he&mdash;Edmond&mdash;must suffer. They will kill
him, they will burn the Manor House over his
head."</p>

<p>"I cannot find it in my heart to blame thee for
bringing me in hopes to save thy lover," he said
gently, "yet I should not have come had the message
read, 'My lover needs thee,'&mdash;remember it
was, 'Thy people need thee!'"</p>

<p>She clung to his gown.</p>

<p>"Nay, then, thy people do need thee. Think,
will it help the people's Cause that they come to
the King with hands reddened in the blood of his
nobles? Remember, de Leaufort is a kinsman of
the King."</p>

<p>"True, true," he said, "I will go, not to save thy
lover. I go, but to save the people&mdash;if I can&mdash;from
themselves. I cannot promise thee I shall
be in time, but if word of mine can serve, there
shall be no further violence."</p>

<p>Holding his cross high up over his head, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>gazed at it an instant outlined against the flaming
sun, and took a quick step forward.</p>

<p>"In Thy name! In Thy name! I go! I go!"</p>

<p>But she detained him yet an instant. Throwing
herself once more before him, she bent her
head low to his sandals.</p>

<p>"Pray for me, pray for me. To-morrow my
mother's death-bed shall be mine. Remember in
thy prayers poor Rose Westel."</p>

<p>At first he looked down upon her wildly, as if
in his eagerness to go he had forgot her very
existence. He heard only her prayer for remembrance.
A fierce reproach swept into his eyes.</p>

<p>"<em>Remember thee in my prayers?</em> Woman, the
one prayer I have known since first I set eyes
on thee has been that I might forget thee!"</p>

<p>And with his face into the sunset he was gone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span></p>



<h2>XXXI</h2>


<p>For a while he swept on oblivious of fatigue
and faintness from lack of food. The one definite
thought in his mind was that he was needed,
there was work for him to do. The success of
the great Uprising was endangered, and he was
on his way to turn failure into victory. He would
bring the men back to reason, he would show
them how much depended upon it that they come
before the King with clean hands.</p>

<p>For the first time in many months the old elixir
of leadership ran through his veins. He was a
man, a worker, once more. The dreamer, the
monk, the scholar were gone&mdash;swallowed up in
a wave of disgust for the life of the past few
months. Of what use had he been to the world?
With infinite toil he had copied a few words from
the Past. What had he done for the unborn
Future? Always with eyes and ears turned
backward, he had been like those unfortunates
on whom Dante had looked with such horror,
who had their faces turned toward their reins. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>seemed a strange whim that he could have delighted
in the calm shelter of the Abbey; he now
regarded it with detestation&mdash;it was the false
peace against which his master, John Wyclif, had
warned him. He was again breasting the stormy
currents of life. The call of his people had come
to him, and he was on his way to them. His
long sleep was over. He was awake now. They
needed him. He would save them.</p>

<p>"I am coming," he tried to shout, but he was
voiceless, and suddenly his knees sank under him
and he fell heavily to the ground.</p>

<p>For a long time he lay on the ground unconscious.
As consciousness slowly and painfully
came back to him, he looked about him wildly,
and tried to recall what had happened. He was
lying among the fens before the Cathedral. He
was chilled through with the ooze of the swamp
soaking up through the long grasses which were
crushed beneath him where he had fallen. He
found it impossible to rise. The land lay
wrapped in the silence of evening. He could
hear only the voices of frogs unceasingly ringing
like sleigh bells, an occasional sobbing sigh of the
wind as it touched the line of rushes, and the
sucking of the water into the grasses as he
stirred.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span></p>
<p>A terrible sense of some task to be done oppressed
him. What was it? For a long time he
gazed dumbly up at the sullen steely clouds that
were driving across the heavens with a powerful
rush and swirl. A damp sea fog was coming in
from the ocean, and only now and then could he
see the outlines of the Cathedral, looming up
grimly against the horizon, cold and dark and
forbidding, as some great monster looking down
in triumph on his helplessness.</p>

<p>Of a sudden there were lights moving in the
distance where lay the highroad to Sudbury.
They moved about restlessly as if borne on the
shoulders of moving men. Sometimes they
halted, and sometimes they grouped themselves
in twos and threes, and again they moved on
rhythmically in regular unison. Hoarse cries and
orders came to him in muffled tones, and at last
he could make out that some people were singing,
and by listening intently, he could just make out
the words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">"With right and with might</div>
      <div class="verse">With skill and with will;</div>
      <div class="verse">Let might help right,</div>
      <div class="verse">And skill go before will</div>
      <div class="verse">And right before might</div>
      <div class="verse">So goeth our mill aright."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>God! he understood.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span></p>
<p>The refrain carried him back, oh, so long ago,
when he had kneeled before the altar of yonder
Minster, and the stirring words had come to him
as a message from God. How full of strength
and vigor was he then!</p>

<p>Those flashing lights in the distance meant that
the men were already forming, and on their way
to the Manor. They would set fire to it, doubtless,
and they would deal roughly with the Baron;
it was all too likely that they would kill him.
And what would the King have to say to the murderers
of the great Baron de Leaufort? Oh, they
must be saved from committing this terrible folly.
Of course they would be saved. Was he not
on his way now to save them? He would
hold them in control; he would make them
con well their own song, that right must go
before might. He would march with them and
not leave them again until they stood before the
King, and he as spokesman would approach and
say:&mdash;</p>

<p>"O King Richard, we are leal men and not
traitors, as we have been falsely called. These
men but seek to be free men, and to have the love
of life and the life of love which should be all
men's, be he king or caitiff."</p>

<p>He would do this.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span></p>
<p>He made another attempt to rise, but sank
back again among the grasses.</p>

<p>"Oh, my God, my God, wherefore hast Thou
forsaken me?"</p>

<p>The full bitterness of his helplessness rushed
over him. A clod of clay!&mdash;forsooth, he was less
than a clod of clay. He was of less use to the world
than the smallest blade of grass, or the tiniest drop
of dew. He could do nothing. He had to lie there
and watch those lights disappear, and though his
heart and his mind and his soul went with
them, his body must remain there, prone among
the bogs. What a failure he had made of his
life. The one crucial call had come for him, and
he could not answer "Adsum."</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"By their fruits ye shall know them."</p></div>

<p>What fruit had he to show? He was as a tree
that had fallen by the wayside, uprooted, worthless.
It was because of late he had been swallowed
up in the thought of personal salvation&mdash;the
monastic idea, which, after all, was but a sublimated
selfishness. And how came it that he,
of all others, should have fallen into the fatal
error of killing his body instead of preserving it
for noble ends? His life at the Abbey had not
conquered his body, it had permitted his body to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>conquer him. The weaker the body, the stronger
its sway. He looked back on his days of youthful
strength, when he had contemplated with disgust
the unkempt, wild-eyed hermits with their
locks matted thick about their temples, when they
appeared in their dirty rags along the highway,
begging alms to keep body and soul together.
How he had scorned the false ideals of those
hermits who dared to call themselves the truest
Christians. And how much better had he done
with his own life? Wrecked it, wrecked it high
and dry on the barren rocks of monasticism.</p>

<p>"My beloved Master hath called, and I have
failed Him," he cried out again and again in his
despair.</p>

<p>Ely Minster had withdrawn itself entirely into
the night, but to one so familiar with its contour
as Annys, it was easy to carve it out from the
surrounding darkness; to him it still dominated
the landscape as at high noon. He recalled the
defiance which he had launched at it as he had
stood before it in the November gloaming.</p>

<p>"Be not over triumphant, even now," he murmured;
"thou art doomed to bow thy haughty
head in this land of stalwart men."</p>

<p>Perhaps it was not yet too late to redeem himself.
Surely that great God who had put the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>breath of life into his nostrils could at will fill his
loins with strength. Perhaps he had succumbed
too readily. He would have faith.</p>

<p>"I would seek unto God," Job's prayer rose to
his lips, "and unto God would I commit my cause,
which doeth great things and unsearchable; marvellous
things without number."</p>

<p>The wind that had stirred lazily through the
reeds now suddenly freshened. Gathering
strength, at last it whipped the fog before it,
scurrying across the land. As it parted the white
veil before the cathedral, the moon was just peeping
above the roof. As it sailed over the octagon
it left Ely Minster below, carven out of the impenetrable
night&mdash;etched against the brightening
sky, it stood out grimmer, gloomier, than ever.</p>

<p>As the moon climbed the heavens, the beams
rested on the rugged pile. Little by little its
frown was smoothed out, a tremor swept over it,
and it smiled. No longer fearsome, no longer
wrapped in gloom, it appeared in the soft radiance,
a celestial vision. The arcades of pointed
arches, the exquisite stone parapet, the pinnacled
turrets of the divine octagon, the noble towers,
all stood forth in their fairylike delicacy of detail,
and yet in all the simple majesty of the complete
creation.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span></p>
<p>His heart beat tumultuously. The spectacle
seemed to him too beautiful for the eyes of man to
behold. To him there was a desecration&mdash;a sacrilegiousness&mdash;in
his presence there as this glorious
being bared her full loveliness to her lover night.</p>

<p>Then there came a voice into the wind&mdash;the
voice that had appeared unto Isaiah of old:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Thou art my servant, I have chosen thee and not cast
thee away; fear not, for I am with thee; be not dismayed,
for I am thy God; I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help
thee; yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness."</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span></p>



<h2>XXXII</h2>


<p>The men pressed on through the night wearilessly.
In the hearts of all was the joy of living
a moment which had lit up the horizon for two-score
years and more. Of a large body of men
some there were whose throats craved the rare
wines that were stored in my lord's cellars, whose
stomachs hungered for the grain of the well-filled
garner-houses, whose fingers longed for the contents
of the great oaken chests, bursting with precious
stuffs. Yet the large majority of them
scorned such base motives. These were idealists,
throwing away the small advantage of the
moment for the greater advantage of the morrow.
Many, strong in the faith of their leaders, had
flung hand from the plough which at least had
kept starvation from their bodies. Surely the
moon looking down that night witnessed a strange
sight&mdash;a deeply significant, portentous sight&mdash;the
laborers, ill clad, with the marks of their toil yet
upon them, armed only with cracked bows, broken
swords, rusty staves, axes, scythes, whips, and even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>stout sticks, going forth fearlessly to meet trained
armies. And the moon, looking down that night,
found not only the highroad between Ely and
Sudbury alive with marching men, but also the
highroad that lay between Canterbury and Mile
End, and that between Peterborough and St.
Alban's, and that which led from Lincoln to
Huntington, and the one from Southampton to
Maidstone. From the north, from the east, and
from the south, wherever the moon turned its
face, the roads were black with the men, for the
signal had been given, and the great Uprising
had begun.</p>

<p>On the way, small wonder that some bodies of
men, grown sullen by the long wait, broke the
bounds their leaders would have put upon them,
and satisfied their private enmities. Some set
fire to all the homes of lawyers that they came
upon, for too long had the lawyers lived off the
slavery of the people; others cut off the heads
of all the clerks they encountered, because the
land was lumbered with them; others attacked
monasteries and burned the records, that their
bondage could not be proven to the future, doing
their work so thoroughly as to toss on the flaming
pile every book and bit of writing they could
lay their hands on; still more waylaid teachers of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>grammar, and made them take great oaths that
they would henceforth cease teaching youngsters
to read and write,&mdash;for what was the good of
clerkliness save to gain a mysterious and unjust
power over the workers of the fields?</p>

<p>The great god Demos, after centuries of dreamless
sleep, throwing off his sluggishness with
effort, only partially articulate as yet, staggering
on awkwardly, aimlessly, blindly,&mdash;drunk with
the sudden revelation of his own huge strength,
a tragic picture enough with his great heart reaching
out toward some Ideal, but not quite knowing
what it was, nor how to get it. When at last
this great monster, in the shape of ten thousand
laborers on the banks of the Thames, was to
appear before the King&mdash;what was the welcome
that would be tendered? Demos was politely
informed by a noble earl that he was not costumed
fitly to meet the King. The giant, tamed by the
very insolence and unexpectedness of the weapon
used, the one weapon perchance before which he
would have quailed&mdash;acknowledged a temporary
defeat. Not dressed to appear before the King!
And who, forsooth, had made the laws that poor
men may not go abroad save in russet cloth?
Why had they not made that answer?</p>

<p>When the men of Cambridgeshire reached the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>Manor of the Baron de Leaufort, he awoke and
sent his bailiff down to them. The bailiff was
a man who trusted in the stability of the feudal
structure of society as few trust in the permanence
of heaven.</p>

<p>"What would ye," he cried; "wot ye no better
than to disturb his Lordship at this time o' night?
Disperse instanter, and if it be that ye have aught
to say on the morrow when ye are sober, my Lord
bids me say he will hold a love-day, and listen to
your complaints."</p>

<p>"We want no love-day," sang out one, surlily.</p>

<p>"Who are we?" cried another, "we are those
who want no bailiff to tell us what to do. We
want to see the Baron. Order him to come
straightway."</p>

<p>The bailiff gasped. "<em>Order</em> the Baron!" The
heavens could tremble, after all! "Varlets! Idle
churls! How dare ye talk so insolently? By my
two ears some of ye will hang for this night's work."</p>

<p>"Now thou hast but one ear to swear by," cried
a great fellow, approaching the bailiff and slicing
off one ear with a stroke of his knife.</p>

<p>The bailiff screamed and clapped his hand to
his bleeding head. "The land is full enough of
bailiffs," shouted some.</p>

<p>"Seize him, seize him," cried others.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span></p>
<p>The heavens had fallen. His fat cheeks were
chalky and hung flabbily under his eyes. He saw
his mistake. He should have been more conciliatory.
"Hold, fellows, what would ye, drink?"</p>

<p>But his trembling voice was lost in the babble
that arose as two or three took hold of him and
bore him along, shrieking pitifully. As those that
carried him seemed not to know what to do with
their burden, a man solved the problem by reaching
forth a rusty sword and severing the head
from the body. In a trice half a dozen fellows
were after the rolling head, and had raised it,
dripping, upon a lance. The lance they stuck
into the ground with the head lifted on high, that
all might see. Several others busied themselves
with picking up twigs and branches, and in a few
minutes they had a roaring bonfire in a wide circle
about the lance, so that the curling flames lit
up its hideous, ghastly burden.</p>

<p>The men danced about the fire in glee.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, Sir Bailiff," they mocked, "who are
we, indeed? Do you know us now, Master
Bailiff?"</p>

<p>While others said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"We are thy master, now, Sir Bailiff, and the
masters of all England from this night on."</p>

<p>"Serfs and villeins ye be, and serfs and villeins
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>ye remain," called a strong, contemptuous voice
from the doorway.</p>

<p>They paused, and saw de Leaufort standing
coolly before them. His arms were folded on his
breast. He had not taken the trouble to arm
himself. Surely a noble of the realm need not
quail before his own villeins. He also held feudalism
a law of the universe.</p>

<p>"Begone, madmen," he commanded. "Disperse
to your homes! Ye must be all out of your senses;
the scourge and the whip shall bring them back
to you, I promise you. Not many shall see his
feet for many days to come."</p>

<p>Then, as he caught sight of the bailiff's head
stuck on the lance, he started back in amazement
at their daring. Before he could speak again, a
dozen fellows pushed him roughly from the door
and made their way into the house. "Stay," he
cried hoarsely; but no one paid the slightest
attention to him, save that one or two, in passing,
plucked at his beard, and one clapped his hand
familiarly on his shoulders, and called him
"Brother." "For," he said, "from to-night we
all shall be brothers throughout the land, and not
masters and slaves."</p>

<p>The Baron passed one hand across his brow as
if he, too, were taking leave of his senses. Was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>it some terrible nightmare? He had been warned
that the people were rising, he had expected some
setting forth of grievances, and perhaps some slight
show of force; but insolence like this was past all
belief.</p>

<p>As he stood hesitating, there approached John
Kyrkeby to him, who stuck a huge clenched fist
into his face and said surlily: "Look you, Baron
de Leaufort, the time for such as you has come.
The land has groaned long enough under the
sway of barons and earls. Mark me, there are
some here who will not rest till your blood soak
this ground. I think myself they have gone far
enough, yet keep a civil tongue within your head,
or it will roll on the earth as that other did.
Have a care, or I cannot protect you."</p>

<p>"Thou protect me, indeed!" cried de Leaufort,
drawing himself up proudly. "I am well used to
hold my back up to thee to be measured for the
cloth, but I shall never demean myself by holding
it to thee for protection. Indeed! wilt protect
me with thy shears?"</p>

<p>The man gave a hoarse laugh. "Ay! it tastes
strangely on the tongue, does it not? Yet, mark
me, the signs of my trade will be remembered
and thought somewhat of long after yours will
be forgotten; for, of a truth, the time is come
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>when men must earn their bread, as Holy Writ
saith, by the sweat of their brow, or go breadless."</p>

<p>The Baron made an impatient gesture and
turned to enter the house.</p>

<p>"Here," cried the tailor, "bind him! it will do
no harm to keep him from mischief."</p>

<p>Twenty men rushed upon de Leaufort to do
their leader's bidding. His eyes darted fire.
"Touch me not," he cried, "caitiffs! I suffer
no such indignity at your hands. Kill me, and
ye will find that I can die as a brave soldier, but
I cannot owe my life to dogs."</p>

<p>An arrow let fly grazed his cheek and drew
blood.</p>

<p>"Bring me the man that shot that," shouted
Kyrkeby; "another arrow, and it will stick from
his own hulk."</p>

<p>While they were securing the Baron, who was
obliged to submit, dozens of fellows came rushing
from the house as if shot out of a catapult, tumbling
over one another, carrying jewelled goblets
and precious vases, casks of wine, suits of mail,
and oaken chests.</p>

<p>Some set upon the chests and ripped them
open with axes, and allowed the contents to scatter
on the ground; others burst open casks of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>wine, and what was not soaked into the earth
speedily went to make the mob the wilder.</p>

<p>"To the fire, to the fire, in with them," they
shouted.</p>

<p>Some obeyed. Others first decked themselves
out in the fineries and strutted up and down and
cut queer capers, curious as children to know how
it would feel to have a long tail dragging behind
them as they walked. One fellow was seen to
slip a jewelled goblet into his tunic. He was
instantly jerked from his feet, and at a nod from
their leader was thrown bodily on to the flames,
the jewelled goblet aimed after him. The fellow
screamed in agony, and some seemed taken aback,
but the multitude approved, and cried out:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thus do we serve all thieves."</p>

<p>"We are honest men, not thieves; we shall
cast the jewels and the gewgaws on the flames,
but it must not be said that we burn down manors
only to rob their contents," cried Simon the smith.</p>

<p>The Baron stood on one side, his arms bound
to his side, one moment cursing under his breath,
and the next assuming a stolid indifference as
he watched one after another of his possessions
thrown on the bonfire, and disappear in a pillar
of flame. Suddenly some fellows created a new
diversion by making a cross-piece of two lances,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>and rigging it up with a huge pile of fineries
which had been dragged from one of the chests.
This they dressed in a surcoat of tyretain furred
with the skins of many martens, throwing over it
a long mantle of velvet, lined with ermine, and
surmounting the whole with a magnificent scarlet
hat with a large white plume nodding from it,
and a great clasp of gold in the very front.
Then, standing at a distance from this effigy,
the men gleefully riddled it with arrows. Tiring
of this sport, some one snatched a burning
brand from the fire and flung it, showering
sparks in every direction, upon the roof of the
Manor House. Instantly more brands were
thrown on by other willing hands, and the house
was soon roaring so fiercely that the men had to
give way before it.</p>

<p>"Fellows, this is the man who has undone by
force our lovely Rose Westel, the handsomest
maid in Cambridgeshire."</p>

<p>A strange light came into de Leaufort's eyes.
Could this be, after all, but a woman's revenge?</p>

<p>A hoarse shout arose from a hundred throats.</p>

<p>"Throw him back into his own house."</p>

<p>"It will give him a warm enough welcome."</p>

<p>"Off with his head."</p>

<p>"We will bear it with us to Blackheath and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>set it up there that all may know who are the
masters of England."</p>

<p>The Baron closed his eyes and calmly awaited
the fatal stroke which he knew could not be long
delayed.</p>

<p>It came; but notwithstanding its perfect aim, it
did not strike de Leaufort, but sent a jet of hot
blood from the white kerchief of a woman who had
rushed from the darkness to fling her arms about
him.</p>

<p>He bent over her with a hoarse cry, tugging at
his bonds until one from pity severed them with
a stroke of his knife.</p>

<p>"Rose, Rose, you here?"</p>

<p>She opened her eyes and smiled. Death bore
a radiant visage, seeing that her lover's arms
were about her, his breath was on her cheeks,
her life was for his. A tall, slender figure sprang
to her side, pressed a crucifix against her stiffening
lips, and all was over.</p>

<p>Murmuring the prayer for the dead, the figure
kneeled in solemn contemplation of the lovely
face, and then suddenly drew itself up and turned
its burning eyes upon the throng. A shiver ran
through them all. It was their old leader, Robert
Annys.</p>

<p>For an instant he looked on them in silence.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>In his face, grief and pity, and anger and indignation,
all struggled for mastery. As his gaze
wandered to the rich stuffs, trampled and soiled
on the ground, the shattered, gaping chests,
the twisted pieces of silver and gilt, and finally the
lance with the grewsome head surveying the
smoking and blackened ruins of the Manor House,
at last the indignation&mdash;passionate, intense&mdash;conquered.</p>

<p>"How came ye so to shame our Cause?" The
words burst from him at white heat.</p>

<p>"What is this before me?" he asked; "a gathering
of thieves and robbers and murderers, or of
true men&mdash;workers who are throwing down their
tools that their brethren may also have bread
between their teeth? Are we men in whose
bosoms burns the desire to sweep off the face of
the earth all unruth and injustice and wrong? or
are we, as some men say of us, but varlets whose
envy and greed make us lust for the ease of the
gentles? Are we seeking to build up or to destroy?
Answer me that! I tell you, fellow-men,
we dare not come before the King with our hands
dripping with blood and the land laid waste by
our torches. And how dare we come before God
with a prayer for justice on our lips, but only envy
and murder in our hearts?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span></p>
<p>The men stood in awed silence, looking up at
Annys, who seemed to tower above them in his
righteous indignation&mdash;Robert Annys, beloved of
all, who had put himself again at their head as by
a miracle.</p>

<p>The beautifully modulated voice swept on, the
voice with the old familiar ring in it, the voice
that once had wielded such power over them.
Impassioned it continued, and yet with the overtone
of a great pity and tenderness now vibrating
through it.</p>

<p>"O my fellows, I would have died to spare you
this. Right gladly would I now lay down this
poor life if thereby I could know that ye shall
live henceforth as free men. But to be free men,
we must first deserve to be free. Is this the kind
of men we seek to prove ourselves? Is this the
best we wish the others to think of us? O my
brothers, no enemy could have so completely
undone you, as ye yourselves have done. Know
you not that men may call you the scum of the
earth and all vile names, but there is no power
on earth that can make you so, save just yourselves?
O my brothers, remember this. Cease,
cease trailing our sacred Cause in the dust.
Arise and follow me to the King, and come before
him with head erect and look him in the eyes as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>man to man. Let him see that we be no hang-dog
murderers, but that the Great Uprising had
its birth in Truth and Righteousness. It lies in
our hands whether it go down to unborn generations
as a God-given Uprising of the people
against unjust tyrants, or a hellish insurrection of
rapine and incendiarism and bloodshed. If this
is true,&mdash;and who can gainsay it?&mdash;who are your
worst enemies, unless it be yourselves? See to
it, lest, in thinking to conquer others, ye but fall
before your baser selves."</p>

<p>Not one spoke. Had one so much as shrugged
a shoulder, it must have been heard.</p>

<p>The speaker watched the upturned faces, and
slowly it came over him that no longer did he
look upon the faces of murderers. As he had
spoken, the hot passions of greed and envy and
hatred and revenge passed from out their hearts,
and now he knew that in their place he had
planted faith and hope and patience.</p>

<p>If he could have but faced all those souls who
were marching on to Blackheath that night!
Surely, some pages of English history had read
differently!</p>

<p>But his strength, miraculously kept up to this
point, now failed him. As he sank back into the
arms of a sturdy fellow who had waited by his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>side, seeing that he swayed from weakness, he
closed his eyes wearily and sighed gently as if at
peace. For he was supremely happy, since in the
end he had come back to those that loved him,
and had been suffered to do them service.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span></p>



<h2>XXXIII</h2>


<p>One year later, the sun that flashed from Ely's
towers flashed from the points of a thousand
spears, from as many burnished helmets and glittering
coats of mail, from the polished wood of
hundreds of crossbows, from the resplendent surfaces
of emblazoned shields, and from shining
battle-axes, swinging against the glossy haunches
of war-horses. It lit up splendid sword belts of
rose, azure, and vermilion, tabards superb with
armorial bearings, tunics and surcoats gamboised
and interlaced with silks of yellow, blue, and flame
color; it illumined waving pennons and guidons,
and the more stately banners with their oft-repeated
device of St. George and the dragon, or
the golden keys of St. Peter.</p>

<p>There at the head of his troops rode the proud
figure of the fighting Bishop, Spencer of Norwich,
his closely wrought suit of mail and helmet
of finest blue steel rings, his surcoat of blue velvet,
his gorget of the same, draped from the helmet.
Blue flashed against blue, the clever handiwork
of man and the illimitable cerulean of the sky.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span></p>
<p>Every reason had Spencer of Norwich to be
proud, for the Pope had appointed him special
commissioner to raise and conduct a crusade
in succor of brave Ghent against the minions of
Antichrist at Avignon. Even now he was on
his way to join the rest of his army to set sail later
from Dover. For once the Pope's war was the
people's war. For once the interests of the nation
and the Papacy were one, and the wealth of England
need not be squandered in the support of two
opposing armies. Not only was England asked
to fight its hereditary enemy, France, but it was
asked to succor a brave people who had thrown
off the sway of a ducal ruler and had gathered
about a simple Flandrish burgher. No wonder
that the plain people responded enthusiastically
to this call. The very severity that Bishop Spencer
had displayed in putting down the Uprising of
the summer before now redounded to his credit&mdash;served
to strengthen their confidence in him as a
military leader.</p>

<p>Urban, thoroughly in earnest in striking a telling
blow against Avignon, now outdid himself in
his concessions to those who poured their wealth
and treasure at his feet. Not alone was absolution
granted them, but during this great emergency
it became possible to obtain it for dead friends
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>and relatives. Here was a masterly stroke indeed;
for who could hesitate to sacrifice a paltry string
of jewels, or a golden goblet or two, to put out
the flames that encompassed a beloved one? It
would seem that, did the treasure cease pouring
from castle and manor for a single day, a few well-directed
sermons dwelling somewhat fondly on
the tortures of hell-fire were sufficient to make
the streams gush forth again!</p>

<p>Yet, notwithstanding the enthusiasm with
which this army was raised and equipped, there
rose through the land some bold voices protesting
that, when the Lords and Knights and Bishops
assembled at Westminster, it would have been
better had they redressed the wrongs of the peasants,
and restored quiet and order to the realm by
wise internal regulations, instead of turning their
eyes across the seas and voting moneys for a war
that would neither raise up ruined manor houses
nor restore wasted lands. Indeed, Wyclif and his
fast-growing band of Lollards cried out in no
uncertain tones that the whole quarrel between the
contending Popes had to do only with worldly
power and mastery, which was entirely unbefitting
a Pope and wholly contrary to the example of
Christ. "Neither the slaying of men nor the impoverishment
of whole countries can be the outcome
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>of love to the Lord Jesus Christ," solemnly
enjoined the great master, who, even with
the hand of Death upon him, remained undaunted,
suffering only his body to be conquered.</p>

<p>While the people of Ely had shouted themselves
hoarse, and swung banners, and waved kerchiefs,
two quiet figures had looked sadly, silently
on, a man and a woman. They had watched the
triumphant army pass, setting the dull fenland
ablaze with color as it moved. When the last
thread of scarlet was caught up in the blue haze
where the sluggish river made its last bend, the
couple turned their faces to the Cathedral. As they
looked, the swamp at their feet suddenly burst
into flame and then as suddenly darkened as the
red sun sank. The low sparse trees, rising from
the water, blackened against the horizon; the
orange and the rose slowly faded from the sky,
the violet-gray pallor of the night creeping over
it. The rapture of day's meeting with night was
over, and all the passion burned out. A few
scattered groups of villagers passed them by,
chatting eagerly, and then all was still. The
man sighed heavily. The woman turned to him
a quiet face, full of resolute courage. If there
was anything to mar her perfect happiness, it was
that the people had apparently been oblivious of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>their dissenting presence. Not a jeer had
sounded, not a stone had been thrown. Sweeter
far to her than an ardent meeting of their own
Lollard followers was any opportunity&mdash;however
small&mdash;to suffer martyrdom for the sacred Cause.
She marvelled greatly when news came to her
from time to time of comrades recanting in the
face of torture. She would have counted it a
blessed privilege to die for the Truth, smiling
into the eyes of her tormentors.</p>

<p>And this was Ely! Ah, the wonderful old
church! even in the gathering darkness it still
crowned the wide landscape. She divined the
poignant memories that were stirring in her husband's
breast. Twice before had he faced Ely
Minster,&mdash;once proudly defiant on the threshold
of life, once stricken in the bitter consciousness
of defeat. This time in his heart was neither
defiance nor despair. He could not defy, for he
looked no longer on the Cathedral as an enemy to
be crushed, but as a force to be yoked into service.
If there was some condemnation in his heart, yet
there was reverence as well. Reverence, for he
was passionately responsive to the Mystery and
Power before him. Impotent indeed he believed
the new religion would be if it reckoned not with
this Power, if it tossed it aside as worthless.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>Rather should it forge to itself with imperishable
links the mighty forces that dwelt in that stirring
Presence.</p>

<p>Neither could he despair, for while at one time
he had worked with feverish energy in the stirring
sight of a fixed goal, now he had learned the
difficult lesson of working on in perfect courage
and perfect steadfastness for an end which he
could never hope to see, which he knew could be
accomplished only by God in the fulness of His
time.</p>

<p>How much had taken place in the twelvemonth
that had passed since he had faced Ely Minster!
He had not died on that awful night, although he
had thought it the end and had welcomed it.
But he had gone through a long and serious illness.
Tenderly nursed by Matilda, and safely
hidden from those who were going about the
land slaying all the poor priests they could lay
hands on, little by little he had regained his
strength until he could endure the telling of the
terrible end of the Uprising. As soon as he
could, he made a pilgrimage to Lutterworth, and
there had a last solemn talk with John Wyclif.
Once more he took up the threads of life, once
more under orders from his old master. And
with his bodily ills he cast off those of his moral
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>nature. At last wholly hers, he could ask Matilda
to be his wife&mdash;no warring, clamorous instincts
now, his whole being in perfect harmony resolving
itself into love for her.</p>

<p>The Uprising was a thing of the past. It had
taken more than forty years to come, a few swift
days had seen its end. For one brief moment
England had lain at the feet of Piers Ploughman,
poor Piers never less truly conqueror than then!
The gaol at Maidstone had been broken into, and
John Ball placed again at the head of his people;
the palace of the most powerful Duke of the realm
had been sacked and reduced to ashes; the head of
the Archbishop of Canterbury, Primate of all England,
had grinned from the top of London bridge
in grim companionship with the murdered Treasurer
of the nation. On the top of the pillory in
the Bury market-place, the lifeless lips of the
Chief Justice of England pressed those of the
Prior of the Monastery in ghastly jest on
the league between Church and Law against
poor Piers. Yea, all England at the feet of its
rustics&mdash;and to what end? To disperse to their
homes, drunk with joy over the roseate promises
of their King. The true value of a King's promise
was to be learned later. Never again would a
King be to them quite so kingly, since one had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>turned the faith and loyalty of his people against
them as the weapon of their destruction. The
scores of clerks, busily writing articles of manumission
while there was a rioter to be seen,
were soon as busily engaged in writing new articles
of bondage more galling than ever. The
free pardon of all who had taken part in the
Uprising, which the King so readily promised,
meant the death of some seven thousands of
rebels, among them beloved John Ball, quartered
and hung swaying on the gates of St. Alban's
as an example to all.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
"<cite>By their fruits ye shall know them.</cite>"<br />
</div>

<p>Again Robert Annys recalled that text as he
stood this time before the Cathedral. But no
longer it agonized him as on that night when
he lay prone among the rushes. Now he saw
deeper into the heart of things. He saw that
the fruit of the tree is the fruit not alone of the
leafy bough on which it hangs, nor alone of the
strong, gnarled trunk, nor alone of the roots, deep
down and hidden; but that it is borne alike of the
kernel that has taken many seasons to reach the
height of a man, alike of the very rainfalls that
have fed the roots with the salts of the soil.
Who indeed shall ever account for all the forces
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>that have gone to redden its cheeks and sweeten
its juices?</p>

<p>The Uprising had failed because the people
were not yet ready for success. They had failed
in self-command, and therefore had grievously
failed to command others. It was hard to look
into the future with any show of bravery when
one realized how much, how much the people
must learn, how much work there was to be done
by a few strong, patient souls. And yet, to Robert
Annys the very failure of the Uprising had
within it something precious. He believed that
if no slightest seed may fall to the ground unheeded,
surely the earnest efforts of thousands
upon thousands of men could not be suffered to
fall barren upon Eternity.</p>

<p>And he was right. Who shall ever say all that
was done or not done by that wonderful outspeaking
of the heart of the English peasantry more
than half a thousand years ago&mdash;that stirring
voice sinking again into silence as mysteriously
as it arose? And yet who shall say that it was
hushed? Is it not nearer the truth to say that it
was held in the air, vibrating down through the
centuries, silent unto Man, only until such time
as his ears were attuned to hearken?</p>

<p>Indeed, easier is it to trace the tall waving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>corn back to the tiny, hard grain that was tossed
upon the waiting earth; easier to trace the proud
mast that cleaves the air high up over the seas,
back to the pine cone's quiet fall; easier to trace
the broad flowing river, ship-studded, artery of
great, toiling cities, to the hidden pool where the
trout leap and the deer come down to drink,&mdash;than
to trace through the remotest Past the mysterious
ebb and flow, the wonderful crossing and
recrossing, of the springs of Human Action.</p>

<p>In truth no historian may ever tell of the end
of the Great Uprising, for it had no end, but it
goeth ever on and on.</p>

<p>"Marion Crawford's latest story, 'In the Palace of the King,' is quite
up to the level of his best works for cleverness, grace of style, and sustained
interest. It is, besides, to some extent a historical story, the scene
being the royal palace at Madrid, and the author drawing the characters
of Philip II. and Don John of Austria with an attempt, in a broad, impressionist
way, at historic faithfulness. His reproduction of the life at
the Spanish court is as brilliant and picturesque as any of his Italian
scenes, and in minute study of detail is, in a real and valuable sense, true
history."&mdash;<cite>The Advance.</cite></p>

<p>"Mr. Crawford has taken a love story of vital interest and has related
the web of facts simply, swiftly, and with moderation ... a story as
brilliant as it is romantic in its setting. Here his genius for story telling
is seen at its best."&mdash;<cite>Boston Herald.</cite></p>

<p>"For sustained intensity and graphic description Marion Crawford's new
novel is inapproachable in the field of recent fiction."&mdash;<cite>Times Union</cite>, Albany.</p>

<p>"Don John of Austria's secret marriage with the daughter of one of
King Philip's officers is the culminating point of this story.... An
assassination, a near approach to a palace revolution, a great scandal,
and some very pretty love-making, besides much planning and plotting,
take place."&mdash;<cite>Boston Transcript.</cite></p>

<p>"Mr. Crawford wastes no time in trying to re-create history, but puts
his reader into the midst of those bygone scenes and makes him live in
them.... In scenes of stirring dramatic intensity.... It all seems intensely
real so long as one is under the novelist's spell."&mdash;<cite>Chicago Tribune.</cite></p>

<p>"No man lives who can endow a love tale with a rarer charm than
Crawford."&mdash;<cite>San Francisco Evening Bulletin.</cite></p>

<p>"No book of the season has been more eagerly anticipated, and none
has given more complete satisfaction ... a drama of marvellous power
and exceptional brilliancy, forceful and striking ... holding the reader's
interest spell-bound from the first page of the story to the last, reached
all too soon."&mdash;<cite>The Augusta Herald.</cite></p>

<p class="center big"><big>THE LIFE AND DEATH OF<br />
RICHARD YEA AND NAY</big><br />
<br />
By MAURICE HEWLETT<br /></p>

<p class="center"><i>Author of "The Forest Lovers," "Little Novels of Italy," etc.</i><br />
<br />
Cloth.      12mo.       $1.50</p>


<p>"The hero of Mr. Hewlett's latest novel is Richard C&oelig;ur de Lion, whose
character is peculiarly suited to the author's style. It is on a much wider
plan than 'The Forest Lovers,' and while not historical in the sense of
attempting to follow events with utmost exactness, it will be found to give
an accurate portrayal of the life of the day, such as might well be expected
from the author's previous work. There is a varied and brilliant background,
the scene shifting from France to England, and also to Palestine.
In a picturesque way, and a way that compels the sympathies of his readers,
Mr. Hewlett reads into the heart of King Richard C&oelig;ur de Lion, showing
how he was torn by two natures and how the title 'Yea and Nay' was
peculiarly significant of his character."&mdash;<cite>Boston Herald.</cite></p>

<p>"The tale by itself is marvellously told; full of luminous poetry;
intensely human in its passion; its style, forceful and picturesque; its
background, a picture of beauty and mysterious loveliness; the whole,
radiant with the very spirit of romanticism as lofty in tone and as serious
in purpose as an epic poem. It is a book that stands head and shoulders
above the common herd of novels&mdash;the work of a master hand."&mdash;<cite>Indianapolis
News.</cite></p>

<p>"Mr. Hewlett has done one of the most notable things in recent literature,
a thing to talk about with abated breath, as a bit of master-craftsmanship
touched by the splendid dignity of real creation."&mdash;<cite>The Interior.</cite></p>

<p>"The whole book is a brilliant defence of Evolution, a scholarly statement
of the case. Never before has that great science been so presented;
never before has there been such a passionate yet thrilling appeal."&mdash;<cite>Courier
Journal.</cite></p>

<p>"This is a tremendous subject to put into a novel; but the effort is so
daring, and the treatment so frank and masterly on its scientific side, that
the book is certain to command a wide hearing, perhaps to provoke wide
controversy."&mdash;<cite>Tribune</cite>, Chicago.</p>

<p>"'When a man has heard the great things calling to him, how they call,
and call, day and night, day and night!' This is really the foundation idea,
the golden text, of Mr. James Lane Allen's new and remarkable novel."&mdash;<cite>Evening
Transcript</cite>, Boston.</p>

<p>"In all the characteristics that give Mr. Allen's novels such distinction
and charm 'The Reign of Law' is perhaps supreme ... but it is pre-eminently
the study of a soul ... religion is here the dominant note."&mdash;<cite>The
New York Times' Saturday Review.</cite></p>

<p>"In David there is presented one of the noblest types of our fiction;
the incarnation of brilliant mentality and splendid manhood.... No
portrait in contemporary literature is more symbolic of truth and honor."&mdash;<cite>The
Times</cite>, Louisville.</p>

<p>"Mr. Allen has a style as original and almost as perfectly finished as
Hawthorne's, and he has also Hawthorne's fondness for spiritual suggestion
that makes all his stories rich in the qualities that are lacking in so
many novels of the period.... If read in the right way, it cannot fail
to add to one's spiritual possessions."&mdash;<cite>San Francisco Chronicle.</cite></p>
